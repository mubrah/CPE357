Assignment 1 Decomposition
- Parse command line arguments 
    - Unit test by echoing user input with specified arrays of strings
- Verify command line arguments
    - Unit test by echoing user input when fed string meets certain criteria
- Simplify input 'sets' by reducing escape sequences into characters
    - Unit test by echoing input set containing escaped sequences with
      corrected characters  
- Read and write input character by character
    - Use getchar and putchar
    - If translate mode, change input text with defined mapping
    - If delete mode, remove characters in set
    - Unit test by seeing if translate and delete subroutines work correctly
      with varying sets and inputs  

Integration Test: Feed program with varying correct and erroneous input and see
that correct result is achieved
