      <br /> O'er better waves to speed her rapid course<br /> The light bark of
      my genius lifts the sail,<br /> Well pleas'd to leave so cruel sea behind;<br />
      And of that second region will I sing,<br /> In which the human spirit from
      sinful blot<br /> Is purg'd, and for ascent to Heaven prepares.<br /> <br />Here,
      O ye hallow'd Nine! for in your train<br /> I follow, here the deadened
      strain revive;<br /> Nor let Calliope refuse to sound<br /> A somewhat
      higher song, of that loud tone,<br /> Which when the wretched birds of
      chattering note<br /> Had heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope.<br />
      <br />Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread<br /> O'er the serene
      aspect of the pure air,<br /> High up as the first circle, to mine eyes<br />
      Unwonted joy renew'd, soon as I 'scap'd<br /> Forth from the atmosphere of
      deadly gloom,<br /> That had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.<br />
      The radiant planet, that to love invites,<br /> Made all the orient laugh,
      and veil'd beneath<br /> The Pisces' light, that in his escort came.<br />

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />To the right hand I turn'd, and fix'd my mind<br />
      On the' other pole attentive, where I saw<br /> Four stars ne'er seen
      before save by the ken<br /> Of our first parents. &nbsp;Heaven of their
      rays<br /> Seem'd joyous. &nbsp;O thou northern site, bereft<br /> Indeed,
      and widow'd, since of these depriv'd!<br /> <br />As from this view I had
      desisted, straight<br /> Turning a little tow'rds the other pole,<br />
      There from whence now the wain had disappear'd,<br /> I saw an old man
      standing by my side<br /> Alone, so worthy of rev'rence in his look,<br />
      That ne'er from son to father more was ow'd.<br /> Low down his beard and
      mix'd with hoary white<br /> Descended, like his locks, which parting fell<br />
      Upon his breast in double fold. &nbsp;The beams<br /> Of those four
      luminaries on his face<br /> So brightly shone, and with such radiance
      clear<br /> Deck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun.<br /> <br />"Say who are
      ye, that stemming the blind stream,<br /> Forth from th' eternal
      prison-house have fled?"<br /> He spoke and moved those venerable plumes.<br />
      "Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure<br /> Lights you emerging from
      the depth of night,<br /> That makes the infernal valley ever black?<br />
      Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss<br /> Broken, or in high heaven
      new laws ordain'd,<br /> That thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?"<br />

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />My guide, then laying hold on me, by words<br />
      And intimations given with hand and head,<br /> Made my bent knees and eye
      submissive pay<br /> Due reverence; then thus to him replied.<br /> <br />"Not
      of myself I come; a Dame from heaven<br /> Descending, had besought me in
      my charge<br /> To bring. &nbsp;But since thy will implies, that more<br />
      Our true condition I unfold at large,<br /> Mine is not to deny thee thy
      request.<br /> This mortal ne'er hath seen the farthest gloom.<br /> But
      erring by his folly had approach'd<br /> So near, that little space was
      left to turn.<br /> Then, as before I told, I was dispatch'd<br /> To work
      his rescue, and no way remain'd<br /> Save this which I have ta'en. &nbsp;I
      have display'd<br /> Before him all the regions of the bad;<br /> And
      purpose now those spirits to display,<br /> That under thy command are
      purg'd from sin.<br /> How I have brought him would be long to say.<br />
      From high descends the virtue, by whose aid<br /> I to thy sight and
      hearing him have led.<br /> Now may our coming please thee. &nbsp;In the
      search<br /> Of liberty he journeys: that how dear<br /> They know, who for
      her sake have life refus'd.<br /> Thou knowest, to whom death for her was
      sweet<br /> In Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,<br /> That in the
      last great day will shine so bright.<br /> For us the' eternal edicts are
      unmov'd:<br /> He breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,<br /> Abiding in
      that circle where the eyes<br /> Of thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in
      look<br /> Prays thee, O hallow'd spirit! to own her shine.<br /> Then by
      her love we' implore thee, let us pass<br /> Through thy sev'n regions; for
      which best thanks<br /> I for thy favour will to her return,<br /> If
      mention there below thou not disdain."<br /> <br />"Marcia so pleasing in my
      sight was found,"<br /> He then to him rejoin'd, "while I was there,<br />
      That all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.<br /> Now that beyond the'
      accursed stream she dwells,<br /> She may no longer move me, by that law,<br />
      Which was ordain'd me, when I issued thence.<br /> Not so, if Dame from
      heaven, as thou sayst,<br /> Moves and directs thee; then no flattery
      needs.<br /> Enough for me that in her name thou ask.<br /> Go therefore
      now: and with a slender reed<br /> See that thou duly gird him, and his
      face<br /> Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.<br /> For not
      with eye, by any cloud obscur'd,<br /> Would it be seemly before him to
      come,<br /> Who stands the foremost minister in heaven.<br /> This islet all
      around, there far beneath,<br /> Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed<br />
      Produces store of reeds. No other plant,<br /> Cover'd with leaves, or
      harden'd in its stalk,<br /> There lives, not bending to the water's sway.<br />
      After, this way return not; but the sun<br /> Will show you, that now
      rises, where to take<br /> The mountain in its easiest ascent."<br /> <br />He
      disappear'd; and I myself uprais'd<br /> Speechless, and to my guide
      retiring close,<br /> Toward him turn'd mine eyes. &nbsp;He thus began;<br />
      "My son! observant thou my steps pursue.<br /> We must retreat to rearward,
      for that way<br /> The champain to its low extreme declines."<br /> <br />The
      dawn had chas'd the matin hour of prime,<br /> Which deaf before it, so
      that from afar<br /> I spy'd the trembling of the ocean stream.<br /> <br />We
      travers'd the deserted plain, as one<br /> Who, wander'd from his track,
      thinks every step<br /> Trodden in vain till he regain the path.<br /> <br />When
      we had come, where yet the tender dew<br /> Strove with the sun, and in a
      place, where fresh<br /> The wind breath'd o'er it, while it slowly dried;<br />
      Both hands extended on the watery grass<br /> My master plac'd, in graceful
      act and kind.<br /> Whence I of his intent before appriz'd,<br /> Stretch'd
      out to him my cheeks suffus'd with tears.<br /> There to my visage he anew
      restor'd<br /> That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal'd.<br /> <br />Then
      on the solitary shore arriv'd,<br /> That never sailing on its waters saw<br />
      Man, that could after measure back his course,<br /> He girt me in such
      manner as had pleas'd<br /> Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!<br />
      As he selected every humble plant,<br /> Wherever one was pluck'd, another
      there<br /> Resembling, straightway in its place arose. <br /><br /> <a

      <br /> Now had the sun to that horizon reach'd,<br /> That covers, with the
      most exalted point<br /> Of its meridian circle, Salem's walls,<br /> And
      night, that opposite to him her orb<br /> Sounds, from the stream of Ganges
      issued forth,<br /> Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp'd<br />
      When she reigns highest: so that where I was,<br /> Aurora's white and
      vermeil-tinctur'd cheek<br /> To orange turn'd as she in age increas'd.<br />
      <br />Meanwhile we linger'd by the water's brink,<br /> Like men, who,
      musing on their road, in thought<br /> Journey, while motionless the body
      rests.<br /> When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,<br /> Through the thick
      vapours Mars with fiery beam<br /> Glares down in west, over the ocean
      floor;<br /> So seem'd, what once again I hope to view,<br /> A light so
      swiftly coming through the sea,<br /> No winged course might equal its
      career.<br /> From which when for a space I had withdrawn<br /> Thine eyes,
      to make inquiry of my guide,<br /> Again I look'd and saw it grown in size<br />
      And brightness: thou on either side appear'd<br /> Something, but what I
      knew not of bright hue,<br /> And by degrees from underneath it came<br />
      Another. &nbsp;My preceptor silent yet<br /> Stood, while the brightness,
      that we first discern'd,<br /> Open'd the form of wings: then when he knew<br />
      The pilot, cried aloud, "Down, down; bend low<br /> Thy knees; behold God's
      angel: fold thy hands:<br /> Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed."<br />

      distant shores.<br /> Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear'd,<br />
      Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,<br /> That not like mortal
      hairs fall off or change!"<br /> <br />As more and more toward us came, more
      bright<br /> Appear'd the bird of God, nor could the eye<br /> Endure his
      splendor near: I mine bent down.<br /> He drove ashore in a small bark so
      swift<br /> And light, that in its course no wave it drank.<br /> The
      heav'nly steersman at the prow was seen,<br /> Visibly written blessed in
      his looks.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="images/02-42.jpg">ENLARGE TO

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.<br /> "In
      Exitu Israel de Aegypto;"<br /> All with one voice together sang, with what<br />
      In the remainder of that hymn is writ.<br /> Then soon as with the sign of
      holy cross<br /> He bless'd them, they at once leap'd out on land,<br /> The
      swiftly as he came return'd. The crew,<br /> There left, appear'd astounded
      with the place,<br /> Gazing around as one who sees new sights.<br /> <br />From
      every side the sun darted his beams,<br /> And with his arrowy radiance
      from mid heav'n<br /> Had chas'd the Capricorn, when that strange tribe<br />
      Lifting their eyes towards us: "If ye know,<br /> Declare what path will
      Lead us to the mount."<br /> <br />Them Virgil answer'd. &nbsp;"Ye suppose
      perchance<br /> Us well acquainted with this place: but here,<br /> We, as
      yourselves, are strangers. &nbsp;Not long erst<br /> We came, before you
      but a little space,<br /> By other road so rough and hard, that now<br />
      The' ascent will seem to us as play." &nbsp;The spirits,<br /> Who from my
      breathing had perceiv'd I liv'd,<br /> Grew pale with wonder. &nbsp;As the
      multitude<br /> Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,<br /> To hear
      what news he brings, and in their haste<br /> Tread one another down, e'en
      so at sight<br /> Of me those happy spirits were fix'd, each one<br />
      Forgetful of its errand, to depart,<br /> Where cleans'd from sin, it might
      be made all fair.<br /> <br />Then one I saw darting before the rest<br />
      With such fond ardour to embrace me, I<br /> To do the like was mov'd.
      &nbsp;O shadows vain<br /> Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands<br />
      I clasp'd behind it, they as oft return'd<br /> Empty into my breast again.
      &nbsp;Surprise<br /> I needs must think was painted in my looks,<br /> For
      that the shadow smil'd and backward drew.<br /> To follow it I hasten'd,
      but with voice<br /> Of sweetness it enjoin'd me to desist.<br /> Then who
      it was I knew, and pray'd of it,<br /> To talk with me, it would a little
      pause.<br /> It answered: "Thee as in my mortal frame<br /> I lov'd, so
      loos'd forth it I love thee still,<br /> And therefore pause; but why
      walkest thou here?"<br /> <br />"Not without purpose once more to return,<br />
      Thou find'st me, my Casella, where I am<br /> Journeying this way;" I said,
      "but how of thee<br /> Hath so much time been lost?" &nbsp;He answer'd
      straight:<br /> "No outrage hath been done to me, if he<br /> Who when and
      whom he chooses takes, me oft<br /> This passage hath denied, since of just
      will<br /> His will he makes. &nbsp;These three months past indeed,<br />
      He, whose chose to enter, with free leave<br /> Hath taken; whence I
      wand'ring by the shore<br /> Where Tyber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd
      kind<br /> Admittance, at that river's mouth, tow'rd which<br /> His wings
      are pointed, for there always throng<br /> All such as not to Archeron
      descend."<br /> <br />Then I: "If new laws have not quite destroy'd<br />
      Memory and use of that sweet song of love,<br /> That while all my cares

      Began in such soft accents, that within<br /> The sweetness thrills me yet.
      &nbsp;My gentle guide<br /> And all who came with him, so well were
      pleas'd,<br /> That seem'd naught else might in their thoughts have room.<br />
      <br />Fast fix'd in mute attention to his notes<br /> We stood, when lo!

      What negligence detains you loit'ring here?<br /> Run to the mountain to
      cast off those scales,<br /> That from your eyes the sight of God conceal."<br />
      <br />As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food<br /> Collected, blade or
      tares, without their pride<br /> Accustom'd, and in still and quiet sort,<br />
      If aught alarm them, suddenly desert<br /> Their meal, assail'd by more

      <br /> Them sudden flight had scatter'd over the plain,<br /> Turn'd tow'rds
      the mountain, whither reason's voice<br /> Drives us; I to my faithful
      company<br /> Adhering, left it not. &nbsp;For how of him<br /> Depriv'd,
      might I have sped, or who beside<br /> Would o'er the mountainous tract
      have led my steps<br /> He with the bitter pang of self-remorse<br /> Seem'd
      smitten. &nbsp;O clear conscience and upright<br /> How doth a little fling
      wound thee sore!<br /> <br />Soon as his feet desisted (slack'ning pace),<br />
      From haste, that mars all decency of act,<br /> My mind, that in itself
      before was wrapt,<br /> Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor'd:<br />
      And full against the steep ascent I set<br /> My face, where highest to
      heav'n its top o'erflows.<br /> <br />The sun, that flar'd behind, with
      ruddy beam<br /> Before my form was broken; for in me<br /> His rays
      resistance met. &nbsp;I turn'd aside<br /> With fear of being left, when I
      beheld<br /> Only before myself the ground obscur'd.<br /> When thus my
      solace, turning him around,<br /> Bespake me kindly: "Why distrustest thou?<br />
      Believ'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?<br /> It now is evening
      there, where buried lies<br /> The body, in which I cast a shade, remov'd<br />
      To Naples from Brundusium's wall. &nbsp;Nor thou<br /> Marvel, if before me
      no shadow fall,<br /> More than that in the sky element<br /> One ray
      obstructs not other. &nbsp;To endure<br /> Torments of heat and cold
      extreme, like frames<br /> That virtue hath dispos'd, which how it works<br />
      Wills not to us should be reveal'd. &nbsp;Insane<br /> Who hopes, our

      substance knit.<br /> Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;<br />
      Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been<br /> For Mary to bring

      To whose desires repose would have been giv'n,<br /> That now but serve
      them for eternal grief.<br /> I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,<br /> And
      others many more." &nbsp;And then he bent<br /> Downwards his forehead, and
      in troubled mood<br /> Broke off his speech. &nbsp;Meanwhile we had arriv'd<br />
      Far as the mountain's foot, and there the rock<br /> Found of so steep
      ascent, that nimblest steps<br /> To climb it had been vain. &nbsp;The most
      remote<br /> Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract<br /> 'Twixt Lerice
      and Turbia were to this<br /> A ladder easy' and open of access.<br /> <br />"Who
      knows on which hand now the steep declines?"<br /> My master said and
      paus'd, "so that he may<br /> Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?"<br />
      And while with looks directed to the ground<br /> The meaning of the
      pathway he explor'd,<br /> And I gaz'd upward round the stony height,<br />
      Of spirits, that toward us mov'd their steps,<br /> Yet moving seem'd not,
      they so slow approach'd.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />I thus my guide address'd: "Upraise thine eyes,<br />
      Lo that way some, of whom thou may'st obtain<br /> Counsel, if of thyself
      thou find'st it not!"<br /> <br />Straightway he look'd, and with free

      thou be firm in hope, my son belov'd."<br /> <br />Now was that people
      distant far in space<br /> A thousand paces behind ours, as much<br /> As at
      a throw the nervous arm could fling,<br /> When all drew backward on the
      messy crags<br /> Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov'd<br /> As one
      who walks in doubt might stand to look.<br /> <br />"O spirits perfect! O
      already chosen!"<br /> Virgil to them began, "by that blest peace,<br />
      Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar'd,<br /> Instruct us where the
      mountain low declines,<br /> So that attempt to mount it be not vain.<br />
      For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves."<br /> <br />As sheep,
      that step from forth their fold, by one,<br /> Or pairs, or three at once;
      meanwhile the rest<br /> Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose<br /> To
      ground, and what the foremost does, that do<br /> The others, gath'ring
      round her, if she stops,<br /> Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;<br />
      So saw I moving to advance the first,<br /> Who of that fortunate crew were
      at the head,<br /> Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.<br /> When
      they before me had beheld the light<br /> From my right side fall broken on
      the ground,<br /> So that the shadow reach'd the cave, they stopp'd<br />
      And somewhat back retir'd: the same did all,<br /> Who follow'd, though
      unweeting of the cause.<br /> <br />"Unask'd of you, yet freely I confess,<br />
      This is a human body which ye see.<br /> That the sun's light is broken on
      the ground,<br /> Marvel not: but believe, that not without<br /> Virtue
      deriv'd from Heaven, we to climb<br /> Over this wall aspire." &nbsp;So
      them bespake<br /> My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin'd;<br /> "Turn,
      and before you there the entrance lies,"<br /> Making a signal to us with
      bent hands.<br /> <br />Then of them one began. &nbsp;"Whoe'er thou art,<br />
      Who journey'st thus this way, thy visage turn,<br /> Think if me elsewhere
      thou hast ever seen."<br /> <br />I tow'rds him turn'd, and with fix'd eye
      beheld.<br /> Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,<br /> He seem'd, but
      on one brow a gash was mark'd.<br /> <br />When humbly I disclaim'd to have
      beheld<br /> Him ever: "Now behold!" &nbsp;he said, and show'd<br /> High on
      his breast a wound: then smiling spake.<br /> <br />"I am Manfredi, grandson

      by two mortal blows<br /> My frame was shatter'd, I betook myself<br />
      Weeping to him, who of free will forgives.<br /> My sins were horrible; but
      so wide arms<br /> Hath goodness infinite, that it receives<br /> All who
      turn to it. &nbsp;Had this text divine<br /> Been of Cosenza's shepherd

      drives, out of the kingdom's bounds,<br /> Far as the stream of Verde,
      where, with lights<br /> Extinguish'd, he remov'd them from their bed.<br />
      Yet by their curse we are not so destroy'd,<br /> But that the eternal love

      repent,<br /> Must wander thirty-fold for all the time<br /> In his
      presumption past; if such decree<br /> Be not by prayers of good men
      shorter made<br /> Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;<br />
      Revealing to my good Costanza, how<br /> Thou hast beheld me, and beside

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />We through the broken rock ascended, close<br />

      From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.<br /> I wearied thus began:
      "Parent belov'd!<br /> Turn, and behold how I remain alone,<br /> If thou
      stay not."&mdash;"My son!" &nbsp;He straight reply'd,<br /> "Thus far put

      projecting, round<br /> Circles the hill. &nbsp;His words so spurr'd me on,<br />
      That I behind him clamb'ring, forc'd myself,<br /> Till my feet press'd the

      To eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft<br /> Many beside have with
      delight look'd back.<br /> <br />First on the nether shores I turn'd my
      eyes,<br /> Then rais'd them to the sun, and wond'ring mark'd<br /> That
      from the left it smote us. &nbsp;Soon perceiv'd<br /> That Poet sage now at
      the car of light<br /> Amaz'd I stood, where 'twixt us and the north<br />
      Its course it enter'd. &nbsp;Whence he thus to me:<br /> "Were Leda's

      discern<br /> Where seem'd my ken to fail, that the mid orb<br /> Of the
      supernal motion (which in terms<br /> Of art is called the Equator, and
      remains<br /> Ever between the sun and winter) for the cause<br /> Thou hast
      assign'd, from hence toward the north<br /> Departs, when those who in the
      Hebrew land<br /> Inhabit, see it tow'rds the warmer part.<br /> But if it
      please thee, I would gladly know,<br /> How far we have to journey: for the
      hill<br /> Mounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount."<br /> <br />He
      thus to me: "Such is this steep ascent,<br /> That it is ever difficult at
      first,<br /> But, more a man proceeds, less evil grows.<br /> When pleasant
      it shall seem to thee, so much<br /> That upward going shall be easy to

      sepulture was known?"<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" &nbsp;answer'd

      <br /> When from their game of dice men separate,<br /> He, who hath lost,
      remains in sadness fix'd,<br /> Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws<br />
      He cast: but meanwhile all the company<br /> Go with the other; one before
      him runs,<br /> And one behind his mantle twitches, one<br /> Fast by his
      side bids him remember him.<br /> He stops not; and each one, to whom his
      hand<br /> Is stretch'd, well knows he bids him stand aside;<br /> And thus
      he from the press defends himself.<br /> E'en such was I in that
      close-crowding throng;<br /> And turning so my face around to all,<br /> And
      promising, I 'scap'd from it with pains.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here
      of Arezzo him I saw, who fell<br /> By Ghino's cruel arm; and him beside,<br />
      Who in his chase was swallow'd by the stream.<br /> Here Frederic Novello,
      with his hand<br /> Stretch'd forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,<br /> Who
      put the good Marzuco to such proof<br /> Of constancy. &nbsp;Count Orso I
      beheld;<br /> And from its frame a soul dismiss'd for spite<br /> And envy,
      as it said, but for no crime:<br /> I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and
      here,<br /> While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant<br /> Let her beware;
      lest for so false a deed<br /> She herd with worse than these. When I was
      freed<br /> From all those spirits, who pray'd for others' prayers<br /> To
      hasten on their state of blessedness;<br /> Straight I began: "O thou, my
      luminary!<br /> It seems expressly in thy text denied,<br /> That heaven's
      supreme decree can never bend<br /> To supplication; yet with this design<br />
      Do these entreat. &nbsp;Can then their hope be vain,<br /> Or is thy saying
      not to me reveal'd?"<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thus to me:
      "Both what I write is plain,<br /> And these deceiv'd not in their hope, if
      well<br /> Thy mind consider, that the sacred height<br /> Of judgment doth
      not stoop, because love's flame<br /> In a short moment all fulfils, which
      he<br /> Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy.<br /> Besides, when I
      this point concluded thus,<br /> By praying no defect could be supplied;<br />
      Because the pray'r had none access to God.<br /> Yet in this deep suspicion
      rest thou not<br /> Contented unless she assure thee so,<br /> Who betwixt
      truth and mind infuses light.<br /> I know not if thou take me right; I
      mean<br /> Beatrice. &nbsp;Her thou shalt behold above,<br /> Upon this
      mountain's crown, fair seat of joy."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
      I: "Sir! let us mend our speed; for now<br /> I tire not as before; and lo!
      the hill<br /> Stretches its shadow far." &nbsp;He answer'd thus:<br /> "Our
      progress with this day shall be as much<br /> As we may now dispatch; but
      otherwise<br /> Than thou supposest is the truth. &nbsp;For there<br /> Thou
      canst not be, ere thou once more behold<br /> Him back returning, who
      behind the steep<br /> Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam<br /> Thou
      dost not break. &nbsp;But lo! a spirit there<br /> Stands solitary, and
      toward us looks:<br /> It will instruct us in the speediest way."<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We soon approach'd it. &nbsp;O thou Lombard
      spirit!<br /> How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,<br /> Scarce
      moving with slow dignity thine eyes!<br /> It spoke not aught, but let us
      onward pass,<br /> Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.<br /> But Virgil with

      "Mantua," the solitary shadow quick<br /> Rose towards us from the place in

      may please ye." &nbsp;Only three steps down<br /> Methinks I measur'd, ere
      I was beneath,<br /> And noted one who look'd as with desire<br /> To know
      me. &nbsp;Time was now that air arrow dim;<br /> Yet not so dim, that
      'twixt his eyes and mine<br /> It clear'd not up what was conceal'd before.<br />
      Mutually tow'rds each other we advanc'd.<br /> Nino, thou courteous judge!
      what joy I felt,<br /> When I perceiv'd thou wert not with the bad!<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No salutation kind on either part<br /> Was
      left unsaid. &nbsp;He then inquir'd: "How long<br /> Since thou arrived'st
      at the mountain's foot,<br /> Over the distant waves?"&mdash;"O!" answer'd
      I,<br /> "Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,<br /> And still in
      my first life, thus journeying on,<br /> The other strive to gain." &nbsp;Soon
      as they heard<br /> My words, he and Sordello backward drew,<br /> As
      suddenly amaz'd. &nbsp;To Virgil one,<br /> The other to a spirit turn'd,
      who near<br /> Was seated, crying: "Conrad! up with speed:<br /> Come, see
      what of his grace high God hath will'd."<br /> Then turning round to me:
      "By that rare mark<br /> Of honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides<br />
      So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,<br /> When thou shalt be beyond
      the vast of waves.<br /> Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call<br /> There,
      where reply to innocence is made.<br /> Her mother, I believe, loves me no
      more;<br /> Since she has chang'd the white and wimpled folds,<br /> Which
      she is doom'd once more with grief to wish.<br /> By her it easily may be
      perceiv'd,<br /> How long in women lasts the flame of love,<br /> If sight
      and touch do not relume it oft.<br /> For her so fair a burial will not
      make<br /> The viper which calls Milan to the field,<br /> As had been made
      by shrill Gallura's bird."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke,
      and in his visage took the stamp<br /> Of that right seal, which with due
      temperature<br /> Glows in the bosom. &nbsp;My insatiate eyes<br />
      Meanwhile to heav'n had travel'd, even there<br /> Where the bright stars
      are slowest, as a wheel<br /> Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir'd:<br />
      "What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?"<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
      answer'd: "The three torches, with which here<br /> The pole is all on
      fire." &nbsp;He then to me:<br /> "The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st
      this morn<br /> Are there beneath, and these ris'n in their stead."<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet he spoke. &nbsp;Sordello to
      himself<br /> Drew him, and cry'd: "Lo there our enemy!"<br /> And with his
      hand pointed that way to look.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along
      the side, where barrier none arose<br /> Around the little vale, a serpent
      lay,<br /> Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.<br /> Between the grass
      and flowers, the evil snake<br /> Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;<br />
      And, as a beast that smoothes its polish'd coat,<br /> Licking his hack.
      &nbsp;I saw not, nor can tell,<br /> How those celestial falcons from their
      seat<br /> Mov'd, but in motion each one well descried,<br /> Hearing the
      air cut by their verdant plumes.<br /> The serpent fled; and to their
      stations back<br /> The angels up return'd with equal flight.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />

      Through all that conflict, loosen'd not his sight.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So
      may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,<br /> Find, in thy destin'd lot,
      of wax so much,<br /> As may suffice thee to the enamel's height."<br /> It
      thus began: "If any certain news<br /> Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part<br />
      Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there<br /> They call'd me
      Conrad Malaspina, not<br /> That old one, but from him I sprang. &nbsp;The
      love<br /> I bore my people is now here refin'd."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In
      your dominions," I answer'd, "ne'er was I.<br /> But through all Europe
      where do those men dwell,<br /> To whom their glory is not manifest?<br />
      The fame, that honours your illustrious house,<br /> Proclaims the nobles
      and proclaims the land;<br /> So that he knows it who was never there.<br />
      I swear to you, so may my upward route<br /> Prosper! your honour'd nation
      not impairs<br /> The value of her coffer and her sword.<br /> Nature and
      use give her such privilege,<br /> That while the world is twisted from his
      course<br /> By a bad head, she only walks aright,<br /> And has the evil
      way in scorn." &nbsp;He then:<br /> "Now pass thee on: sev'n times the
      tired sun<br /> Revisits not the couch, which with four feet<br /> The
      forked Aries covers, ere that kind<br /> Opinion shall be nail'd into thy

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,<br /> Arisen
      from her mate's beloved arms,<br /> Look'd palely o'er the eastern cliff:
      her brow,<br /> Lucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign<br /> Of that
      chill animal, who with his train<br /> Smites fearful nations: and where
      then we were,<br /> Two steps of her ascent the night had past,<br /> And
      now the third was closing up its wing,<br /> When I, who had so much of
      Adam with me,<br /> Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,<br />
      There where all five were seated. &nbsp;In that hour,<br /> When near the

      golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,<br /> With open wings, and hov'ring for
      descent,<br /> And I was in that place, methought, from whence<br /> Young
      Ganymede, from his associates 'reft,<br /> Was snatch'd aloft to the high
      consistory.<br /> "Perhaps," thought I within me, "here alone<br /> He
      strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains<br /> To pounce upon the prey."
      &nbsp;Therewith, it seem'd,<br /> A little wheeling in his airy tour<br />
      Terrible as the lightning rush'd he down,<br /> And snatch'd me upward even

      burn; and so intense th' imagin'd flames,<br /> That needs my sleep was
      broken off. &nbsp;As erst<br /> Achilles shook himself, and round him
      roll'd<br /> His waken'd eyeballs wond'ring where he was,<br /> Whenas his
      mother had from Chiron fled<br /> To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;<br />
      E'en thus I shook me, soon as from my face<br /> The slumber parted,
      turning deadly pale,<br /> Like one ice-struck with dread. &nbsp;Solo at my
      side<br /> My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now<br /> More than two
      hours aloft: and to the sea<br /> My looks were turn'd. &nbsp;"Fear not,"
      my master cried,<br /> "Assur'd we are at happy point. &nbsp;Thy strength<br />
      Shrink not, but rise dilated. &nbsp;Thou art come<br /> To Purgatory now.
      &nbsp;Lo! there the cliff<br /> That circling bounds it! &nbsp;Lo! the
      entrance there,<br /> Where it doth seem disparted! Ere the dawn<br />
      Usher'd the daylight, when thy wearied soul<br /> Slept in thee, o'er the
      flowery vale beneath<br /> A lady came, and thus bespake me: I<br /> Am
      Lucia. &nbsp;Suffer me to take this man,<br /> Who slumbers. &nbsp;Easier
      so his way shall speed."<br /> Sordello and the other gentle shapes<br />
      Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,<br /> This summit reach'd:
      and I pursued her steps.<br /> Here did she place thee. &nbsp;First her
      lovely eyes<br /> That open entrance show'd me; then at once<br /> She
      vanish'd with thy sleep." &nbsp;Like one, whose doubts<br /> Are chas'd by
      certainty, and terror turn'd<br /> To comfort on discovery of the truth,<br />
      Such was the change in me: and as my guide<br /> Beheld me fearless, up
      along the cliff<br /> He mov'd, and I behind him, towards the height.<br />

      now we drew,<br /> Arriv'd' whence in that part, where first a breach<br />
      As of a wall appear'd, I could descry<br /> A portal, and three steps
      beneath, that led<br /> For inlet there, of different colour each,<br /> And
      one who watch'd, but spake not yet a word.<br /> As more and more mine eye
      did stretch its view,<br /> I mark'd him seated on the highest step,<br />
      In visage such, as past my power to bear.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> Grasp'd in his hand a naked sword, glanc'd back<br />
      The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain<br /> My sight directed. &nbsp;"Speak
      from whence ye stand:"<br /> He cried: "What would ye? &nbsp;Where is your
      escort?<br /> Take heed your coming upward harm ye not."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A
      heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,"<br /> Replied the'
      instructor, "told us, even now,<br /> 'Pass that way: here the gate is."&mdash;"And
      may she<br /> Befriending prosper your ascent," resum'd<br /> The courteous
      keeper of the gate: "Come then<br /> Before our steps." &nbsp;We
      straightway thither came.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest
      stair was marble white so smooth<br /> And polish'd, that therein my
      mirror'd form<br /> Distinct I saw. &nbsp;The next of hue more dark<br />
      Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block,<br /> Crack'd lengthwise and
      across. &nbsp;The third, that lay<br /> Massy above, seem'd porphyry, that
      flam'd<br /> Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.<br /> On this God's
      angel either foot sustain'd,<br /> Upon the threshold seated, which
      appear'd<br /> A rock of diamond. &nbsp;Up the trinal steps<br /> My leader
      cheerily drew me. &nbsp;"Ask," said he,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With
      humble heart, that he unbar the bolt."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piously
      at his holy feet devolv'd<br /> I cast me, praying him for pity's sake<br />
      That he would open to me: but first fell<br /> Thrice on my bosom
      prostrate. &nbsp;Seven times<br /> The letter, that denotes the inward
      stain,<br /> He on my forehead with the blunted point<br /> Of his drawn
      sword inscrib'd. &nbsp;And "Look," he cried,<br /> "When enter'd, that thou
      wash these scars away."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashes, or earth
      ta'en dry out of the ground,<br /> Were of one colour with the robe he
      wore.<br /> From underneath that vestment forth he drew<br /> Two keys of
      metal twain: the one was gold,<br /> Its fellow silver. &nbsp;With the
      pallid first,<br /> And next the burnish'd, he so ply'd the gate,<br /> As
      to content me well. &nbsp;"Whenever one<br /> Faileth of these, that in the
      keyhole straight<br /> It turn not, to this alley then expect<br /> Access
      in vain." &nbsp;Such were the words he spake.<br /> "One is more precious:
      but the other needs<br /> Skill and sagacity, large share of each,<br /> Ere
      its good task to disengage the knot<br /> Be worthily perform'd. &nbsp;From
      Peter these<br /> I hold, of him instructed, that I err<br /> Rather in
      opening than in keeping fast;<br /> So but the suppliant at my feet
      implore."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of that hallow'd gate he
      thrust the door,<br /> Exclaiming, "Enter, but this warning hear:<br /> He
      forth again departs who looks behind."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
      in the hinges of that sacred ward<br /> The swivels turn'd, sonorous metal
      strong,<br /> Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily<br /> Roar'd the
      Tarpeian, when by force bereft<br /> Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his
      loss<br /> To leanness doom'd. &nbsp;Attentively I turn'd,<br /> List'ning
      the thunder, that first issued forth;<br /> And "We praise thee, O God,"
      methought I heard<br /> In accents blended with sweet melody.<br /> The
      strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound<br /> Of choral voices, that
      in solemn chant<br /> With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,<br /> Come

      <br /> When we had passed the threshold of the gate<br /> (Which the soul's
      ill affection doth disuse,<br /> Making the crooked seem the straighter
      path),<br /> I heard its closing sound. &nbsp;Had mine eyes turn'd,<br />
      For that offence what plea might have avail'd?<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
      mounted up the riven rock, that wound<br /> On either side alternate, as
      the wave<br /> Flies and advances. &nbsp;"Here some little art<br />
      Behooves us," said my leader, "that our steps<br /> Observe the varying
      flexure of the path."<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we so slowly
      sped, that with cleft orb<br /> The moon once more o'erhangs her wat'ry
      couch,<br /> Ere we that strait have threaded. &nbsp;But when free<br /> We
      came and open, where the mount above<br /> One solid mass retires, I spent,
      with toil,<br /> And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,<br /> Upon a
      plain more lonesome, than the roads<br /> That traverse desert wilds.
      &nbsp;From whence the brink<br /> Borders upon vacuity, to foot<br /> Of the
      steep bank, that rises still, the space<br /> Had measur'd thrice the
      stature of a man:<br /> And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,<br />
      To leftward now and now to right dispatch'd,<br /> That cornice equal in
      extent appear'd.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet our feet had
      on that summit mov'd,<br /> When I discover'd that the bank around,<br />
      Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,<br /> Was marble white, and so
      exactly wrought<br /> With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone<br />
      Had Polycletus, but e'en nature's self<br /> Been sham'd. &nbsp;The angel
      who came down to earth<br /> With tidings of the peace so many years<br />
      Wept for in vain, that op'd the heavenly gates<br /> From their long
      interdict before us seem'd,<br /> In a sweet act, so sculptur'd to the
      life,<br /> He look'd no silent image. One had sworn<br /> He had said,
      "Hail!" for she was imag'd there,<br /> By whom the key did open to God's
      love,<br /> And in her act as sensibly impress<br /> That word, "Behold the
      handmaid of the Lord,"<br /> As figure seal'd on wax. &nbsp;"Fix not thy
      mind<br /> On one place only," said the guide belov'd,<br /> Who had me near
      him on that part where lies<br /> The heart of man. &nbsp;My sight
      forthwith I turn'd<br /> And mark'd, behind the virgin mother's form,<br />
      Upon that side, where he, that mov'd me, stood,<br /> Another story graven
      on the rock.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I passed athwart the bard,
      and drew me near,<br /> That it might stand more aptly for my view.<br />
      There in the self-same marble were engrav'd<br /> The cart and kine,
      drawing the sacred ark,<br /> That from unbidden office awes mankind.<br />
      Before it came much people; and the whole<br /> Parted in seven quires.
      &nbsp;One sense cried, "Nay,"<br /> Another, "Yes, they sing." &nbsp;Like
      doubt arose<br /> Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume<br /> Of
      incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.<br /> Preceding the blest
      vessel, onward came<br /> With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,<br />
      Sweet Israel's harper: in that hap he seem'd<br /> Less and yet more than
      kingly. &nbsp;Opposite,<br /> At a great palace, from the lattice forth<br />
      Look'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn<br /> And sorrow. &nbsp;To behold
      the tablet next,<br /> Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,<br /> I
      mov'd me. &nbsp;There was storied on the rock<br /> The' exalted glory of
      the Roman prince,<br /> Whose mighty worth mov'd Gregory to earn<br /> His
      mighty conquest, Trajan th' Emperor.<br /> A widow at his bridle stood,
      attir'd<br /> In tears and mourning. &nbsp;Round about them troop'd<br />

      <br /> "O thou Almighty Father, who dost make<br /> The heavens thy
      dwelling, not in bounds confin'd,<br /> But that with love intenser there
      thou view'st<br /> Thy primal effluence, hallow'd be thy name:<br /> Join
      each created being to extol<br /> Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and
      praise<br /> Is thy blest Spirit. &nbsp;May thy kingdom's peace<br /> Come
      unto us; for we, unless it come,<br /> With all our striving thither tend
      in vain.<br /> As of their will the angels unto thee<br /> Tender meet
      sacrifice, circling thy throne<br /> With loud hosannas, so of theirs be
      done<br /> By saintly men on earth. &nbsp;Grant us this day<br /> Our daily
      manna, without which he roams<br /> Through this rough desert retrograde,
      who most<br /> Toils to advance his steps. &nbsp;As we to each<br /> Pardon
      the evil done us, pardon thou<br /> Benign, and of our merit take no count.<br />
      'Gainst the old adversary prove thou not<br /> Our virtue easily subdu'd;
      but free<br /> From his incitements and defeat his wiles.<br /> This last
      petition, dearest Lord! is made<br /> Not for ourselves, since that were
      needless now,<br /> But for their sakes who after us remain."<br /> <br />Thus
      for themselves and us good speed imploring,<br /> Those spirits went
      beneath a weight like that<br /> We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore
      beset,<br /> But with unequal anguish, wearied all,<br /> Round the first
      circuit, purging as they go,<br /> The world's gross darkness off: In our
      behalf<br /> If there vows still be offer'd, what can here<br /> For them be
      vow'd and done by such, whose wills<br /> Have root of goodness in them?
      &nbsp;Well beseems<br /> That we should help them wash away the stains<br />
      They carried hence, that so made pure and light,<br /> They may spring
      upward to the starry spheres.<br /> <br />"Ah! &nbsp;so may mercy-temper'd
      justice rid<br /> Your burdens speedily, that ye have power<br /> To stretch
      your wing, which e'en to your desire<br /> Shall lift you, as ye show us on
      which hand<br /> Toward the ladder leads the shortest way.<br /> And if
      there be more passages than one,<br /> Instruct us of that easiest to
      ascend;<br /> For this man who comes with me, and bears yet<br /> The charge
      of fleshly raiment Adam left him,<br /> Despite his better will but slowly
      mounts."<br /> From whom the answer came unto these words,<br /> Which my
      guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said.<br /> <br />"Along the bank to
      rightward come with us,<br /> And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil<br />
      Of living man to climb: and were it not<br /> That I am hinder'd by the
      rock, wherewith<br /> This arrogant neck is tam'd, whence needs I stoop<br />
      My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,<br /> Whose name thou speak'st
      not him I fain would view.<br /> To mark if e'er I knew him? &nbsp;and to
      crave<br /> His pity for the fardel that I bear.<br /> I was of Latiun,
      &nbsp;of a Tuscan horn<br /> A mighty one: Aldobranlesco's name<br /> My
      sire's, I know not if ye e'er have heard.<br /> My old blood and
      forefathers' gallant deeds<br /> Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot<br />
      The common mother, and to such excess,<br /> Wax'd in my scorn of all men,
      that I fell,<br /> Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna's sons,<br /> Each
      child in Campagnatico, can tell.<br /> I am Omberto; not me only pride<br />
      Hath injur'd, but my kindred all involv'd<br /> In mischief with her.
      &nbsp;Here my lot ordains<br /> Under this weight to groan, till I appease<br />
      God's angry justice, since I did it not<br /> Amongst the living, here
      amongst the dead."<br /> <br />List'ning I bent my visage down: and one<br />
      (Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight<br /> That urg'd him, saw me,
      knew me straight, and call'd,<br /> Holding his eyes With difficulty fix'd<br />
      Intent upon me, stooping as I went<br /> Companion of their way. &nbsp;"O!"
      &nbsp;I exclaim'd,<br /> <br />"Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou<br />
      Agobbio's glory, glory of that art<br /> Which they of Paris call the
      limmer's skill?"<br /> <br />"Brother!" said he, "with tints that gayer
      smile,<br /> Bolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves.<br /> His all the
      honour now; mine borrow'd light.<br /> In truth I had not been thus
      courteous to him,<br /> The whilst I liv'd, through eagerness of zeal<br />
      For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.<br /> Here of such pride the
      forfeiture is paid.<br /> Nor were I even here; if, able still<br /> To sin,
      I had not turn'd me unto God.<br /> O powers of man! &nbsp;how vain your
      glory, nipp'd<br /> E'en in its height of verdure, if an age<br /> Less
      bright succeed not! &nbsp;Cimabue thought<br /> To lord it over painting's
      field; and now<br /> The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclips'd.<br /> Thus
      hath one Guido from the other snatch'd<br /> The letter'd prize: and he
      perhaps is born,<br /> Who shall drive either from their nest. &nbsp;The
      noise<br /> Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,<br /> That blows from
      divers points, and shifts its name<br /> Shifting the point it blows from.
      &nbsp;Shalt thou more<br /> Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh<br />
      Part shrivel'd from thee, than if thou hadst died,<br /> Before the coral
      and the pap were left,<br /> Or ere some thousand years have passed? and
      that<br /> Is, to eternity compar'd, a space,<br /> Briefer than is the
      twinkling of an eye<br /> To the heaven's slowest orb. &nbsp;He there who
      treads<br /> So leisurely before me, far and wide<br /> Through Tuscany
      resounded once; and now<br /> Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam'd:<br />
      There was he sov'reign, when destruction caught<br /> The madd'ning rage of
      Florence, in that day<br /> Proud as she now is loathsome. &nbsp;Your
      renown<br /> Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,<br /> And his might
      withers it, by whom it sprang<br /> Crude from the lap of earth." &nbsp;I
      thus to him:<br /> "True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe<br /> The
      kindly spirit of meekness, and allay<br /> What tumours rankle there.
      &nbsp;But who is he<br /> Of whom thou spak'st but now?"--"This," he
      replied,<br /> "Is Provenzano. &nbsp;He is here, because<br /> He reach'd,
      with grasp presumptuous, at the sway<br /> Of all Sienna. &nbsp;Thus he
      still hath gone,<br /> Thus goeth never-resting, since he died.<br /> Such
      is th' acquittance render'd back of him,<br /> Who, beyond measure, dar'd
      on earth." &nbsp;I then:<br /> "If soul that to the verge of life delays<br />
      Repentance, linger in that lower space,<br /> Nor hither mount, unless good
      prayers befriend,<br /> How chanc'd admittance was vouchsaf'd to him?"<br />
      <br />"When at his glory's topmost height," said he,<br /> "Respect of
      dignity all cast aside,<br /> Freely He fix'd him on Sienna's plain,<br /> A
      suitor to &nbsp;redeem his suff'ring friend,<br /> Who languish'd in the
      prison-house of Charles,<br /> Nor for his sake refus'd through every vein<br />
      To tremble. &nbsp;More I will not say; and dark,<br /> I know, my words
      are, but thy neighbours soon<br /> Shall help thee to a comment on the
      text.<br /> This is the work, that from these limits freed him." <br /><br />

      How dear Alcmaeon forc'd his mother rate<br /> That ornament in evil hour
      receiv'd:<br /> How in the temple on Sennacherib fell<br /> His sons, and
      how a corpse they left him there.<br /> Was shown the scath and cruel

      soar, why suffer ye a wind<br /> So slight to baffle ye? &nbsp;He led us on<br />
      Where the rock parted; here against my front<br /> Did beat his wings, then
      promis'd I should fare<br /> In safety on my way. &nbsp;As to ascend<br />
      That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands<br /> (O'er Rubaconte,
      looking lordly down<br /> On the well-guided city,) up the right<br /> Th'
      impetuous rise is broken by the steps<br /> Carv'd in that old and simple
      age, when still<br /> The registry and label rested safe;<br /> Thus is th'
      acclivity reliev'd, which here<br /> Precipitous from the other circuit
      falls:<br /> But on each hand the tall cliff presses close.<br /> <br />As
      ent'ring there we turn'd, voices, in strain<br /> Ineffable, sang: "Blessed
      are the poor<br /> In spirit." &nbsp;Ah how far unlike to these<br /> The
      straits of hell; here songs to usher us,<br /> There shrieks of woe! &nbsp;We
      climb the holy stairs:<br /> And lighter to myself by far I seem'd<br />
      Than on the plain before, whence thus I spake:<br /> "Say, master, of what
      heavy thing have I<br /> Been lighten'd, that scarce aught the sense of
      toil<br /> Affects me journeying?" &nbsp;He in few replied:<br /> "When
      sin's broad characters, that yet remain<br /> Upon thy temples, though well
      nigh effac'd,<br /> Shall be, as one is, all clean razed out,<br /> Then
      shall thy feet by heartiness of will<br /> Be so o'ercome, they not alone

      head is plac'd<br /> Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks<br /> Of
      others as they pass him by; his hand<br /> Lends therefore help to' assure
      him, searches, finds,<br /> And well performs such office as the eye<br />
      Wants power to execute: so stretching forth<br /> The fingers of my right
      hand, did I find<br /> Six only of the letters, which his sword<br /> Who

      <br /> We reach'd the summit of the scale, and stood<br /> Upon the second
      buttress of that mount<br /> Which healeth him who climbs. &nbsp;A cornice
      there,<br /> Like to the former, girdles round the hill;<br /> Save that its
      arch with sweep less ample bends.<br /> <br />Shadow nor image there is

      <br />Far, as is measur'd for a mile on earth,<br /> In brief space had we
      journey'd; such prompt will<br /> Impell'd; and towards us flying, now were
      heard<br /> Spirits invisible, who courteously<br /> Unto love's table bade
      the welcome guest.<br /> The voice, that first? &nbsp;flew by, call'd forth
      aloud,<br /> "They have no wine;" so on behind us past,<br /> Those sounds
      reiterating, nor yet lost<br /> In the faint distance, when another came<br />
      Crying, "I am Orestes," and alike<br /> Wing'd its fleet way. &nbsp;"Oh
      father!" &nbsp;I exclaim'd,<br /> "What tongues are these?" &nbsp;and as I
      question'd, lo!<br /> A third exclaiming, "Love ye those have wrong'd you."<br />
      <br />"This circuit," said my teacher, "knots the scourge<br /> For envy,
      and the cords are therefore drawn<br /> By charity's correcting hand.
      &nbsp;The curb<br /> Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear<br /> (If I

      will?"<br /> <br />"I know not who he is, but know thus much<br /> He comes

      the right two Spirits bending each<br /> Toward the other, talk'd of me,
      then both<br /> Addressing me, their faces backward lean'd,<br /> And thus
      the one began: "O soul, who yet<br /> Pent in the body, tendest towards the

      stretches through the midst of Tuscany,"<br /> I straight began: "a

      Thereof was question'd, did acquit him thus:<br /> "I know not: but 'tis

      Swells out to largeness, e'en so much it finds<br /> Dogs turning into
      wolves. &nbsp;Descending still<br /> Through yet more hollow eddies, next

      His grace in thee, I will be liberal too.<br /> Guido of Duca know then

      This is Rinieri's spirit, this the boast<br /> And honour of the house of
      Calboli,<br /> Where of his worth no heritage remains.<br /> Nor his the
      only blood, that hath been stript<br /> ('twixt Po, the mount, the Reno,
      and the shore,)<br /> Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss;<br /> But
      in those limits such a growth has sprung<br /> Of rank and venom'd roots,
      as long would mock<br /> Slow culture's toil. &nbsp;Where is good Lizio?
      &nbsp;where<br /> Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna?<br /> O bastard slips
      of old Romagna's line!<br /> When in Bologna the low artisan,<br /> And in
      Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts,<br /> A gentle cyon from ignoble stem.<br />
      Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep,<br /> When I recall to mind those
      once lov'd names,<br /> Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him<br /> That dwelt
      with you; Tignoso and his troop,<br /> With Traversaro's house and
      Anastagio's,<br /> (Each race disherited) and beside these,<br /> The ladies
      and the knights, the toils and ease,<br /> That witch'd us into love and
      courtesy;<br /> Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.<br /> O
      Brettinoro! &nbsp;wherefore tarriest still,<br /> Since forth of thee thy
      family hath gone,<br /> And many, hating evil, join'd their steps?<br />

      than in words.<br /> Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart."<br />
      <br />We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard<br /> Our steps. &nbsp;Their
      silence therefore of our way<br /> Assur'd us. &nbsp;Soon as we had quitted

      He drags you eager to him. &nbsp;Hence nor curb<br /> Avails you, nor
      reclaiming call. &nbsp;Heav'n calls<br /> And round about you wheeling
      courts your gaze<br /> With everlasting beauties. &nbsp;Yet your eye<br />

      play,<br /> So much appear'd remaining to the sun<br /> Of his slope journey
      towards the western goal.<br /> <br />Evening was there, and here the noon

      the mountain, circling, so our path<br /> Had led us, that toward the
      sun-set now<br /> Direct we journey'd: when I felt a weight<br /> Of more
      exceeding splendour, than before,<br /> Press on my front. &nbsp;The cause
      unknown, amaze<br /> Possess'd me, and both hands against my brow<br />
      Lifting, I interpos'd them, as a screen,<br /> That of its gorgeous
      superflux of light<br /> Clipp'd the diminish'd orb. As when the ray,<br />
      Striking On water or the surface clear<br /> Of mirror, leaps unto the
      opposite part,<br /> Ascending at a glance, e'en as it fell,<br /> (And so
      much differs from the stone, that falls)<br /> Through equal space, as
      practice skill hath shown;<br /> Thus with refracted light before me seemed<br />
      The ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste<br /> My sight recoil'd.
      &nbsp;"What is this, sire belov'd!<br /> 'Gainst which I strive to shield
      the sight in vain?"<br /> Cried I, "and which towards us moving seems?"<br />
      <br />"Marvel not, if the family of heav'n,"<br /> He answer'd, "yet with
      dazzling radiance dim<br /> Thy sense it is a messenger who comes,<br />
      Inviting man's ascent. &nbsp;Such sights ere long,<br /> Not grievous,
      shall impart to thee delight,<br /> As thy perception is by nature wrought<br />

      "happy thou!<br /> That conquer'st." &nbsp;Lonely each, my guide and I<br />
      Pursued our upward way; and as we went,<br /> Some profit from his words I
      hop'd to win,<br /> And thus of him inquiring, fram'd my speech:<br /> <br />"What
      meant Romagna's spirit, when he spake<br /> Of bliss exclusive with no
      partner shar'd?"<br /> <br />He straight replied: "No wonder, since he
      knows,<br /> What sorrow waits on his own worst defect,<br /> If he chide
      others, that they less may mourn.<br /> Because ye point your wishes at a
      mark,<br /> Where, by communion of possessors, part<br /> Is lessen'd, envy
      bloweth up the sighs of men.<br /> No fear of that might touch ye, if the
      love<br /> Of higher sphere exalted your desire.<br /> For there, by how
      much more they call it ours,<br /> So much propriety of each in good<br />
      Increases more, and heighten'd charity<br /> Wraps that fair cloister in a
      brighter flame."<br /> <br />"Now lack I satisfaction more," said I,<br />
      "Than if thou hadst been silent at the first,<br /> And doubt more gathers
      on my lab'ring thought.<br /> How can it chance, that good distributed,<br />
      The many, that possess it, makes more rich,<br /> Than if 't were shar'd by
      few?" &nbsp;He answering thus:<br /> "Thy mind, reverting still to things
      of earth,<br /> Strikes darkness from true light. &nbsp;The highest good<br />
      Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed<br /> To love, as beam to lucid body
      darts,<br /> Giving as much of ardour as it finds.<br /> The sempiternal
      effluence streams abroad<br /> Spreading, wherever charity extends.<br /> So
      that the more aspirants to that bliss<br /> Are multiplied, more good is
      there to love,<br /> And more is lov'd; as mirrors, that reflect,<br /> Each
      unto other, propagated light.<br /> If these my words avail not to allay<br />
      Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,<br /> Who of this want, and of all

      other round was gain'd, and wond'ring eyes<br /> Did keep me mute. &nbsp;There
      suddenly I seem'd<br /> By an ecstatic vision wrapt away;<br /> And in a
      temple saw, methought, a crowd<br /> Of many persons; and at th' entrance
      stood<br /> A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express<br /> A mother's love,
      who said, "Child! &nbsp;why hast thou<br /> Dealt with us thus? &nbsp;Behold
      thy sire and I<br /> Sorrowing have sought thee;" and so held her peace,<br />
      And straight the vision fled. &nbsp;A female next<br /> Appear'd before me,
      down whose visage cours'd<br /> Those waters, that grief forces out from
      one<br /> By deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say:<br /> "If thou,

      shout amain<br /> "Destroy, destroy!" and him I saw, who bow'd<br /> Heavy

      com'st from it. &nbsp;Ye, who live,<br /> Do so each cause refer to heav'n
      above,<br /> E'en as its motion of necessity<br /> Drew with it all that
      moves. &nbsp;If this were so,<br /> Free choice in you were none; nor
      justice would<br /> There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill.<br /> Your
      movements have their primal bent from heaven;<br /> Not all; yet said I
      all; what then ensues?<br /> Light have ye still to follow evil or good,<br />
      And of the will free power, which, if it stand<br /> Firm and unwearied in
      Heav'n's first assay,<br /> Conquers at last, so it be cherish'd well,<br />
      Triumphant over all. &nbsp;To mightier force,<br /> To better nature
      subject, ye abide<br /> Free, not constrain'd by that, which forms in you<br />
      The reasoning mind uninfluenc'd of the stars.<br /> If then the present
      race of mankind err,<br /> Seek in yourselves the cause, and find it there.<br />
      Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy.<br /> <br />"Forth from his
      plastic hand, who charm'd beholds<br /> Her image ere she yet exist, the
      soul<br /> Comes like a babe, that wantons sportively<br /> Weeping and
      laughing in its wayward moods,<br /> As artless and as ignorant of aught,<br />
      Save that her Maker being one who dwells<br /> With gladness ever,
      willingly she turns<br /> To whate'er yields her joy. &nbsp;Of some slight
      good<br /> The flavour soon she tastes; and, snar'd by that,<br /> With
      fondness she pursues it, if no guide<br /> Recall, no rein direct her
      wand'ring course.<br /> Hence it behov'd, the law should be a curb;<br /> A
      sovereign hence behov'd, whose piercing view<br /> Might mark at least the
      fortress and main tower<br /> Of the true city. &nbsp;Laws indeed there
      are:<br /> But who is he observes them? &nbsp;None; not he,<br /> Who goes
      before, the shepherd of the flock,<br /> Who chews the cud but doth not
      cleave the hoof.<br /> Therefore the multitude, who see their guide<br />
      Strike at the very good they covet most,<br /> Feed there and look no
      further. &nbsp;Thus the cause<br /> Is not corrupted nature in yourselves,<br />
      But ill-conducting, that hath turn'd the world<br /> To evil. &nbsp;Rome,
      that turn'd it unto good,<br /> Was wont to boast two suns, whose several
      beams<br /> Cast light on either way, the world's and God's.<br /> One since
      hath quench'd the other; and the sword<br /> Is grafted on the crook; and
      so conjoin'd<br /> Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw'd<br /> By fear
      of other. &nbsp;If thou doubt me, mark<br /> The blade: each herb is judg'd
      of by its seed.<br /> That land, through which Adice and the Po<br /> Their
      waters roll, was once the residence<br /> Of courtesy and velour, ere the
      day,<br /> That frown'd on Frederick; now secure may pass<br /> Those
      limits, whosoe'er hath left, for shame,<br /> To talk with good men, or
      come near their haunts.<br /> Three aged ones are still found there, in
      whom<br /> The old time chides the new: these deem it long<br /> Ere God
      restore them to a better world:<br /> The good Gherardo, of Palazzo he<br />
      Conrad, and Guido of Castello, nam'd<br /> In Gallic phrase more fitly the
      plain Lombard.<br /> On this at last conclude. &nbsp;The church of Rome,<br />
      Mixing two governments that ill assort,<br /> Hath miss'd her footing,
      fall'n into the mire,<br /> And there herself and burden much defil'd."<br />
      <br />"O Marco!" I replied, shine arguments<br /> Convince me: and the cause
      I now discern<br /> Why of the heritage no portion came<br /> To Levi's
      offspring. &nbsp;But resolve me this<br /> Who that Gherardo is, that as
      thou sayst<br /> Is left a sample of the perish'd race,<br /> And for rebuke
      to this untoward age?"<br /> <br />"Either thy words," said he, "deceive; or
      else<br /> Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,<br /> Appear'st
      not to have heard of good Gherado;<br /> The sole addition that, by which I
      know him;<br /> Unless I borrow'd from his daughter Gaia<br /> Another name
      to grace him. &nbsp;God be with you.<br /> I bear you company no more.
      &nbsp;Behold<br /> The dawn with white ray glimm'ring through the mist.<br />
      I must away--the angel comes--ere he<br /> Appear." &nbsp;He said, and

      <br /> Call to remembrance, reader, if thou e'er<br /> Hast, on a mountain
      top, been ta'en by cloud,<br /> Through which thou saw'st no better, than
      the mole<br /> Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene'er<br /> The
      wat'ry vapours dense began to melt<br /> Into thin air, how faintly the
      sun's sphere<br /> Seem'd wading through them; so thy nimble thought<br />
      May image, how at first I re-beheld<br /> The sun, that bedward now his
      couch o'erhung.<br /> <br />Thus with my leader's feet still equaling pace<br />
      From forth that cloud I came, when now expir'd<br /> The parting beams from
      off the nether shores.<br /> <br />O quick and forgetive power! &nbsp;that
      sometimes dost<br /> So rob us of ourselves, we take no mark<br /> Though
      round about us thousand trumpets clang!<br /> What moves thee, if the
      senses stir not? &nbsp;Light<br /> Kindled in heav'n, spontaneous,
      self-inform'd,<br /> Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse<br /> By
      will divine. &nbsp;Portray'd before me came<br /> The traces of her dire
      impiety,<br /> Whose form was chang'd into the bird, that most<br />
      Delights itself in song: and here my mind<br /> Was inwardly so wrapt, it
      gave no place<br /> To aught that ask'd admittance from without.<br /> <br />Next
      shower'd into my fantasy a shape<br /> As of one crucified, whose visage
      spake<br /> Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;<br /> And round him
      Ahasuerus the great king,<br /> Esther his bride, and Mordecai the just,<br />
      Blameless in word and deed. &nbsp;As of itself<br /> That unsubstantial
      coinage of the brain<br /> Burst, like a bubble, Which the water fails<br />
      That fed it; in my vision straight uprose<br /> A damsel weeping loud, and
      cried, "O queen!<br /> O mother! &nbsp;wherefore has intemperate ire<br />
      Driv'n thee to loath thy being? &nbsp;Not to lose<br /> Lavinia, desp'rate
      thou hast slain thyself.<br /> Now hast thou lost me. &nbsp;I am she, whose
      tears<br /> Mourn, ere I fall, a mother's timeless end."<br /> <br />E'en as
      a sleep breaks off, if suddenly<br /> New radiance strike upon the closed
      lids,<br /> The broken slumber quivering ere it dies;<br /> Thus from before
      me sunk that imagery<br /> Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck<br />
      The light, outshining far our earthly beam.<br /> As round I turn'd me to
      survey what place<br /> I had arriv'd at, "Here ye mount," exclaim'd<br /> A
      voice, that other purpose left me none,<br /> Save will so eager to behold
      who spake,<br /> I could not choose but gaze. &nbsp;As 'fore the sun,<br />
      That weighs our vision down, and veils his form<br /> In light
      transcendent, thus my virtue fail'd<br /> Unequal. &nbsp;"This is Spirit
      from above,<br /> Who marshals us our upward way, unsought;<br /> And in his
      own light shrouds him. As a man<br /> Doth for himself, so now is done for
      us.<br /> For whoso waits imploring, yet sees need<br /> Of his prompt
      aidance, sets himself prepar'd<br /> For blunt denial, ere the suit be
      made.<br /> Refuse we not to lend a ready foot<br /> At such inviting: haste
      we to ascend,<br /> Before it darken: for we may not then,<br /> Till morn
      again return." &nbsp;So spake my guide;<br /> And to one ladder both
      address'd our steps;<br /> And the first stair approaching, I perceiv'd<br />
      Near me as 'twere the waving of a wing,<br /> That fann'd my face and
      whisper'd: "Blessed they<br /> The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath."<br />
      <br />Now to such height above our heads were rais'd<br /> The last beams,
      follow'd close by hooded night,<br /> That many a star on all sides through
      the gloom<br /> Shone out. &nbsp;"Why partest from me, O my strength?"<br />
      So with myself I commun'd; for I felt<br /> My o'ertoil'd sinews slacken.
      &nbsp;We had reach'd<br /> The summit, and were fix'd like to a bark<br />
      Arriv'd at land. &nbsp;And waiting a short space,<br /> If aught should
      meet mine ear in that new round,<br /> Then to my guide I turn'd, and said:
      "Lov'd sire!<br /> Declare what guilt is on this circle purg'd.<br /> If our
      feet rest, no need thy speech should pause."<br /> <br />He thus to me: "The
      love of good, whate'er<br /> Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils.<br />
      Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter'd ill.<br /> But that thou mayst yet
      clearlier understand,<br /> Give ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull<br />
      Some fruit may please thee well, from this delay.<br /> <br />"Creator, nor
      created being, ne'er,<br /> My son," he thus began, "was without love,<br />
      Or natural, or the free spirit's growth.<br /> Thou hast not that to learn.
      &nbsp;The natural still<br /> Is without error; but the other swerves,<br />
      If on ill object bent, or through excess<br /> Of vigour, or defect. &nbsp;While
      e'er it seeks<br /> The primal blessings, or with measure due<br /> Th'
      inferior, no delight, that flows from it,<br /> Partakes of ill. &nbsp;But
      let it warp to evil,<br /> Or with more ardour than behooves, or less.<br />
      Pursue the good, the thing created then<br /> Works 'gainst its Maker.
      &nbsp;Hence thou must infer<br /> That love is germin of each virtue in ye,<br />
      And of each act no less, that merits pain.<br /> Now since it may not be,
      but love intend<br /> The welfare mainly of the thing it loves,<br /> All
      from self-hatred are secure; and since<br /> No being can be thought t'
      exist apart<br /> And independent of the first, a bar<br /> Of equal force
      restrains from hating that.<br /> <br />"Grant the distinction just; and it
      remains<br /> The' evil must be another's, which is lov'd.<br /> Three ways
      such love is gender'd in your clay.<br /> There is who hopes (his
      neighbour's worth deprest,)<br /> Preeminence himself, and coverts hence<br />
      For his own greatness that another fall.<br /> There is who so much fears
      the loss of power,<br /> Fame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount<br />
      Above him), and so sickens at the thought,<br /> He loves their opposite:
      and there is he,<br /> Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame<br />
      That he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs<br /> Must doat on
      other's evil. &nbsp;Here beneath<br /> This threefold love is mourn'd.
      &nbsp;Of th' other sort<br /> Be now instructed, that which follows good<br />
      But with disorder'd and irregular course.<br /> <br />"All indistinctly
      apprehend a bliss<br /> On which the soul may rest, the hearts of all<br />
      Yearn after it, and to that wished bourn<br /> All therefore strive to
      tend. &nbsp;If ye behold<br /> Or seek it with a love remiss and lax,<br />
      This cornice after just repenting lays<br /> Its penal torment on ye.
      &nbsp;Other good<br /> There is, where man finds not his happiness:<br /> It
      is not true fruition, not that blest<br /> Essence, of every good the
      branch and root.<br /> The love too lavishly bestow'd on this,<br /> Along
      three circles over us, is mourn'd.<br /> Account of that division

      Unsated thirst to hear him urg'd, was mute,<br /> Mute outwardly, yet
      inwardly I said:<br /> "Perchance my too much questioning offends."<br />
      But he, true father, mark'd the secret wish<br /> By diffidence restrain'd,
      and speaking, gave<br /> Me boldness thus to speak: "Master, my Sight<br />

      Holds dearest! &nbsp;thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold<br /> That love,
      from which as from their source thou bring'st<br /> All good deeds and
      their opposite." &nbsp;He then:<br /> "To what I now disclose be thy clear
      ken<br /> Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold<br /> How much those blind

      &nbsp;Of substance true<br /> Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,<br />
      And in you the ideal shape presenting<br /> Attracts the soul's regard.
      &nbsp;If she, thus drawn,<br /> incline toward it, love is that inclining,<br />
      And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.<br /> Then as the fire points up,
      and mounting seeks<br /> His birth-place and his lasting seat, e'en thus<br />

      And my own docile mind, reveal. &nbsp;Yet thence<br /> New doubts have
      sprung. &nbsp;For from without if love<br /> Be offer'd to us, and the

      power misus'd: for that his son,<br /> Of body ill compact, and worse in
      mind,<br /> And born in evil, he hath set in place<br /> Of its true
      pastor." &nbsp;Whether more he spake,<br /> Or here was mute, I know not:
      he had sped<br /> E'en now so far beyond us. &nbsp;Yet thus much<br /> I
      heard, and in rememb'rance treasur'd it.<br /> <br />He then, who never
      fail'd me at my need,<br /> Cried, "Hither turn. &nbsp;Lo! &nbsp;two with

      in brief space her form<br /> Decrepit rais'd erect, and faded face<br />
      With love's own hue illum'd. Recov'ring speech<br /> She forthwith warbling

      &nbsp;Or ere her mouth<br /> Was clos'd, to shame her at her side appear'd<br />
      A dame of semblance holy. &nbsp;With stern voice<br /> She utter'd; "Say, O

      then to the sky<br /> Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,<br />
      That woos him thither; so the call I heard,<br /> So onward, far as the
      dividing rock<br /> Gave way, I journey'd, till the plain was reach'd.<br />
      <br />On the fifth circle when I stood at large,<br /> A race appear'd
      before me, on the ground<br /> All downward lying prone and weeping sore.<br />
      "My soul hath cleaved to the dust," I heard<br /> With sighs so deep, they
      well nigh choak'd the words.<br /> "O ye elect of God, whose penal woes<br />
      Both hope and justice mitigate, direct<br /> Tow'rds the steep rising our
      uncertain way."<br /> <br />"If ye approach secure from this our doom,<br />

      still to rightward keep the brink."<br /> <br />So them the bard besought;
      and such the words,<br /> Beyond us some short space, in answer came.<br />
      <br />I noted what remain'd yet hidden from them:<br /> Thence to my liege's
      eyes mine eyes I bent,<br /> And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,<br />
      Beckon'd his glad assent. Free then to act,<br /> As pleas'd me, I drew
      near, and took my stand<br /> O`er that shade, whose words I late had
      mark'd.<br /> And, "Spirit!" &nbsp;I said, "in whom repentant tears<br />
      Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God<br /> Shalt find acceptance,
      for a while suspend<br /> For me that mightier care. &nbsp;Say who thou
      wast,<br /> Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,<br /> And if in aught
      ye wish my service there,<br /> Whence living I am come." &nbsp;He

      weight that robe of sov'reignty<br /> Upon his shoulder rests, who from the
      mire<br /> Would guard it: that each other fardel seems<br /> But feathers
      in the balance. &nbsp;Late, alas!<br /> Was my conversion: but when I
      became<br /> Rome's pastor, I discern'd at once the dream<br /> And cozenage
      of life, saw that the heart<br /> Rested not there, and yet no prouder
      height<br /> Lur'd on the climber: wherefore, of that life<br /> No more
      enamour'd, in my bosom love<br /> Of purer being kindled. &nbsp;For till
      then<br /> I was a soul in misery, alienate<br /> From God, and covetous of
      all earthly things;<br /> Now, as thou seest, here punish'd for my doting.<br />

      Fasten'd below, nor e'er to loftier clime<br /> Were lifted, thus hath
      justice level'd us<br /> Here on the earth. &nbsp;As avarice quench'd our

      So purified, that it may rise, or move<br /> For rising, and such loud
      acclaim ensues.<br /> Purification by the will alone<br /> Is prov'd, that

      eyes, where best<br /> Our looks interpret. "So to good event<br /> Mayst
      thou conduct such great emprize," he cried,<br /> "Say, why across thy
      visage beam'd, but now,<br /> The lightning of a smile!" &nbsp;On either

      Came down the spirit of Aquinum's hard,<br /> Who told of thine affection,
      my good will<br /> Hath been for thee of quality as strong<br /> As ever
      link'd itself to one not seen.<br /> Therefore these stairs will now seem
      short to me.<br /> But tell me: and if too secure I loose<br /> The rein
      with a friend's license, as a friend<br /> Forgive me, and speak now as
      with a friend:<br /> How chanc'd it covetous desire could find<br /> Place
      in that bosom, 'midst such ample store<br /> Of wisdom, as thy zeal had
      treasur'd there?"<br /> <br />First somewhat mov'd to laughter by his words,<br />
      Statius replied: "Each syllable of thine<br /> Is a dear pledge of love.
      &nbsp;Things oft appear<br /> That minister false matters to our doubts,<br />
      When their true causes are remov'd from sight.<br /> Thy question doth
      assure me, thou believ'st<br /> I was on earth a covetous man, perhaps<br />
      Because thou found'st me in that circle plac'd.<br /> Know then I was too
      wide of avarice:<br /> And e'en for that excess, thousands of moons<br />
      Have wax'd and wan'd upon my sufferings.<br /> And were it not that I with
      heedful care<br /> Noted where thou exclaim'st as if in ire<br /> With human
      nature, 'Why, thou cursed thirst<br /> Of gold! dost not with juster
      measure guide<br /> The appetite of mortals?' &nbsp;I had met<br /> The
      fierce encounter of the voluble rock.<br /> Then was I ware that with too
      ample wing<br /> The hands may haste to lavishment, and turn'd,<br /> As
      from my other evil, so from this<br /> In penitence. &nbsp;How many from
      their grave<br /> Shall with shorn locks arise, who living, aye<br /> And at
      life's last extreme, of this offence,<br /> Through ignorance, did not
      repent. &nbsp;And know,<br /> The fault which lies direct from any sin<br />
      In level opposition, here With that<br /> Wastes its green rankness on one
      common heap.<br /> Therefore if I have been with those, who wail<br /> Their
      avarice, to cleanse me, through reverse<br /> Of their transgression, such
      hath been my lot."<br /> <br />To whom the sovran of the pastoral song:<br />
      "While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wag'd<br /> By the twin sorrow of
      Jocasta's womb,<br /> From thy discourse with Clio there, it seems<br /> As
      faith had not been shine: without the which<br /> Good deeds suffice not.
      &nbsp;And if so, what sun<br /> Rose on thee, or what candle pierc'd the
      dark<br /> That thou didst after see to hoist the sail,<br /> And follow,
      where the fisherman had led?"<br /> <br />He answering thus: "By thee
      conducted first,<br /> I enter'd the Parnassian grots, and quaff'd<br /> Of
      the clear spring; illumin'd first by thee<br /> Open'd mine eyes to God.
      &nbsp;Thou didst, as one,<br /> Who, journeying through the darkness, hears
      a light<br /> Behind, that profits not himself, but makes<br /> His
      followers wise, when thou exclaimedst, 'Lo!<br /> A renovated world! &nbsp;Justice
      return'd!<br /> Times of primeval innocence restor'd!<br /> And a new race
      descended from above!'<br /> Poet and Christian both to thee I owed.<br />
      That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace,<br /> My hand shall stretch
      forth to inform the lines<br /> With livelier colouring. &nbsp;Soon o'er
      all the world,<br /> By messengers from heav'n, the true belief<br /> Teem'd
      now prolific, and that word of thine<br /> Accordant, to the new
      instructors chim'd.<br /> Induc'd by which agreement, I was wont<br />
      Resort to them; and soon their sanctity<br /> So won upon me, that,
      Domitian's rage<br /> Pursuing them, I mix'd my tears with theirs,<br />
      And, while on earth I stay'd, still succour'd them;<br /> And their most
      righteous customs made me scorn<br /> All sects besides. &nbsp;Before I led
      the Greeks<br /> In tuneful fiction, to the streams of Thebes,<br /> I was
      baptiz'd; but secretly, through fear,<br /> Remain'd a Christian, and
      conform'd long time<br /> To Pagan rites. &nbsp;Five centuries and more,<br />
      T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace<br /> Round the fourth circle.
      &nbsp;Thou then, who hast rais'd<br /> The covering, which did hide such
      blessing from me,<br /> Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb,<br />
      Say, if thou know, where our old Terence bides,<br /> Caecilius, Plautus,
      Varro: if condemn'd<br /> They dwell, and in what province of the deep."<br />
      "These," said my guide, "with Persius and myself,<br /> And others many
      more, are with that Greek,<br /> Of mortals, the most cherish'd by the
      Nine,<br /> In the first ward of darkness. &nbsp;There ofttimes<br /> We of
      that mount hold converse, on whose top<br /> For aye our nurses live.
      &nbsp;We have the bard<br /> Of Pella, and the Teian, Agatho,<br />
      Simonides, and many a Grecian else<br /> Ingarlanded with laurel. &nbsp;Of
      thy train<br /> Antigone is there, Deiphile,<br /> Argia, and as sorrowful
      as erst<br /> Ismene, and who show'd Langia's wave:<br /> Deidamia with her
      sisters there,<br /> And blind Tiresias' daughter, and the bride<br />
      Sea-born of Peleus." &nbsp;Either poet now<br /> Was silent, and no longer
      by th' ascent<br /> Or the steep walls obstructed, round them cast<br />
      Inquiring eyes. &nbsp;Four handmaids of the day<br /> Had finish'd now
      their office, and the fifth<br /> Was at the chariot-beam, directing still<br />
      Its balmy point aloof, when thus my guide:<br /> "Methinks, it well
      behooves us to the brink<br /> Bend the right shoulder' circuiting the
      mount,<br /> As we have ever us'd." &nbsp;So custom there<br /> Was usher to
      the road, the which we chose<br /> Less doubtful, as that worthy shade
      complied.<br /> <br />They on before me went; I sole pursued,<br /> List'ning
      their speech, that to my thoughts convey'd<br /> Mysterious lessons of
      sweet poesy.<br /> But soon they ceas'd; for midway of the road<br /> A tree
      we found, with goodly fruitage hung,<br /> And pleasant to the smell: and
      as a fir<br /> Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads,<br /> So
      downward this less ample spread, that none.<br /> Methinks, aloft may
      climb. &nbsp;Upon the side,<br /> That clos'd our path, a liquid crystal
      fell<br /> From the steep rock, and through the sprays above<br /> Stream'd
      showering. &nbsp;With associate step the bards<br /> Drew near the plant;
      and from amidst the leaves<br /> A voice was heard: "Ye shall be chary of
      me;"<br /> And after added: "Mary took more thought<br /> For joy and honour
      of the nuptial feast,<br /> Than for herself who answers now for you.<br />
      The women of old Rome were satisfied<br /> With water for their beverage.
      &nbsp;Daniel fed<br /> On pulse, and wisdom gain'd. &nbsp;The primal age<br />

      The more than father warn me: "Son! our time<br /> Asks thriftier using.
      &nbsp;Linger not: away."<br /> <br />Thereat my face and steps at once I
      turn'd<br /> Toward the sages, by whose converse cheer'd<br /> I journey'd
      on, and felt no toil: and lo!<br /> A sound of weeping and a song: "My
      lips,<br /> O Lord!" and these so mingled, it gave birth<br /> To pleasure
      and to pain. &nbsp;"O Sire, belov'd!<br /> Say what is this I hear?" &nbsp;Thus
      I inquir'd.<br /> <br />"Spirits," said he, "who as they go, perchance,<br />
      Their debt of duty pay." &nbsp;As on their road<br /> The thoughtful

      devout.<br /> The eyes of each were dark and hollow: pale<br /> Their
      visage, and so lean withal, the bones<br /> Stood staring thro' the skin.
      &nbsp;I do not think<br /> Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon show'd,<br /> When
      pinc'ed by sharp-set famine to the quick.<br /> <br />"Lo!" to myself I

      turn'd his eyes<br /> In their deep-sunken cell, and fasten'd then<br /> On
      me, then cried with vehemence aloud:<br /> "What grace is this vouchsaf'd

      the which so pines me. &nbsp;Every spirit,<br /> Whose song bewails his

      he paid<br /> Our ransom from his vein." &nbsp;I answering thus:<br />
      "Forese! from that day, in which the world<br /> For better life thou
      changedst, not five years<br /> Have circled. &nbsp;If the power of sinning
      more<br /> Were first concluded in thee, ere thou knew'st<br /> That kindly

      I thought to find thee lower, there, where time<br /> Is recompense for
      time." &nbsp;He straight replied:<br /> "To drink up the sweet wormwood of
      affliction<br /> I have been brought thus early by the tears<br /> Stream'd
      down my Nella's cheeks. &nbsp;Her prayers devout,<br /> Her sighs have
      drawn me from the coast, where oft<br /> Expectance lingers, and have set
      me free<br /> From th' other circles. &nbsp;In the sight of God<br /> So

      replied: "If thou recall to mind<br /> What we were once together, even yet<br />
      Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore.<br /> That I forsook that

      adown the hills."<br /> <br />Thus near one border coasting, still we heard<br />
      The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile<br /> Reguerdon'd. &nbsp;Then along
      the lonely path,<br /> Once more at large, full thousand paces on<br /> We
      travel'd, each contemplative and mute.<br /> <br />"Why pensive journey thus
      ye three alone?"<br /> Thus suddenly a voice exclaim'd: whereat<br /> I
      shook, as doth a scar'd and paltry beast;<br /> Then rais'd my head to look
      from whence it came.<br /> <br />Was ne'er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen<br />
      So bright and glowing red, as was the shape<br /> I now beheld. &nbsp;"If
      ye desire to mount,"<br /> He cried, "here must ye turn. &nbsp;This way he
      goes,<br /> Who goes in quest of peace." &nbsp;His countenance<br /> Had
      dazzled me; and to my guides I fac'd<br /> Backward, like one who walks, as
      sound directs.<br /> <br />As when, to harbinger the dawn, springs up<br />
      On freshen'd wing the air of May, and breathes<br /> Of fragrance, all
      impregn'd with herb and flowers,<br /> E'en such a wind I felt upon my
      front<br /> Blow gently, and the moving of a wing<br /> Perceiv'd, that
      moving shed ambrosial smell;<br /> And then a voice: "Blessed are they,
      whom grace<br /> Doth so illume, that appetite in them<br /> Exhaleth no
      inordinate desire,<br /> Still hung'ring as the rule of temperance wills."

      <br /> It was an hour, when he who climbs, had need<br /> To walk
      uncrippled: for the sun had now<br /> To Taurus the meridian circle left,<br />
      And to the Scorpion left the night. &nbsp;As one<br /> That makes no pause,
      but presses on his road,<br /> Whate'er betide him, if some urgent need<br />

      the young stork lifteth up his wing<br /> Through wish to fly, yet ventures
      not to quit<br /> The nest, and drops it; so in me desire<br /> Of
      questioning my guide arose, and fell,<br /> Arriving even to the act, that
      marks<br /> A man prepar'd for speech. &nbsp;Him all our haste<br />
      Restrain'd not, but thus spake the sire belov'd:<br /> "Fear not to speed
      the shaft, that on thy lip<br /> Stands trembling for its flight." &nbsp;Encourag'd
      thus<br /> I straight began: "How there can leanness come,<br /> Where is no
      want of nourishment to feed?"<br /> <br />"If thou," he answer'd, "hadst
      remember'd thee,<br /> How Meleager with the wasting brand<br /> Wasted
      alike, by equal fires consum'd,<br /> This would not trouble thee: and
      hadst thou thought,<br /> How in the mirror your reflected form<br /> With
      mimic motion vibrates, what now seems<br /> Hard, had appear'd no harder
      than the pulp<br /> Of summer fruit mature. &nbsp;But that thy will<br /> In

      thy presence I unfold to him<br /> The secrets of heaven's vengeance, let
      me plead<br /> Thine own injunction, to exculpate me."<br /> So Statius
      answer'd, and forthwith began:<br /> "Attend my words, O son, and in thy
      mind<br /> Receive them: so shall they be light to clear<br /> The doubt
      thou offer'st. Blood, concocted well,<br /> Which by the thirsty veins is
      ne'er imbib'd,<br /> And rests as food superfluous, to be ta'en<br /> From
      the replenish'd table, in the heart<br /> Derives effectual virtue, that
      informs<br /> The several human limbs, as being that,<br /> Which passes
      through the veins itself to make them.<br /> Yet more concocted it
      descends, where shame<br /> Forbids to mention: and from thence distils<br />
      In natural vessel on another's blood.<br /> Then each unite together, one

      recipient mould: that being reach'd,<br /> It 'gins to work, coagulating
      first;<br /> Then vivifies what its own substance caus'd<br /> To bear.
      &nbsp;With animation now indued,<br /> The active virtue (differing from a
      plant<br /> No further, than that this is on the way<br /> And at its limit
      that) continues yet<br /> To operate, that now it moves, and feels,<br /> As
      sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there<br /> Assumes th' organic powers
      its seed convey'd.<br /> 'This is the period, son! at which the virtue,<br />
      That from the generating heart proceeds,<br /> Is pliant and expansive; for
      each limb<br /> Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann'd.<br /> How babe
      of animal becomes, remains<br /> For thy consid'ring. &nbsp;At this point,
      more wise,<br /> Than thou hast err'd, making the soul disjoin'd<br /> From

      "He seems," said they, "no insubstantial frame:"<br /> Then to obtain what
      certainty they might,<br /> Stretch'd towards me, careful not to overpass<br />
      The burning pale. &nbsp;"O thou, who followest<br /> The others, haply not

      In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these<br /> All for thine answer do

      attention had not turn'd<br /> To new appearance. &nbsp;Meeting these,
      there came,<br /> Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom<br /> Earnestly
      gazing, from each part I view<br /> The shadows all press forward,
      sev'rally<br /> Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away.<br /> E'en so the

      the beast she woo'd<br /> Might rush unto her luxury." &nbsp;Then as

      towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid<br /> The ice, and those the sun;
      so hasteth off<br /> One crowd, advances th' other; and resume<br /> Their
      first song weeping, and their several shout.<br /> <br />Again drew near my
      side the very same,<br /> Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks<br />
      Mark'd eagerness to listen. &nbsp;I, who twice<br /> Their will had noted,
      spake: "O spirits secure,<br /> Whene'er the time may be, of peaceful end!<br />
      My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,<br /> Have I left yonder: here
      they bear me, fed<br /> With blood, and sinew-strung. &nbsp;That I no more<br />
      May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft.<br /> There is a dame on high,
      who wind for us<br /> This grace, by which my mortal through your realm<br />

      Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page<br /> Henceforth to stand recorded)
      who ye are,<br /> And what this multitude, that at your backs<br /> Have
      past behind us." &nbsp;As one, mountain-bred,<br /> Rugged and clownish, if
      some city's walls<br /> He chance to enter, round him stares agape,<br />
      Confounded and struck dumb; e'en such appear'd<br /> Each spirit. &nbsp;But
      when rid of that amaze,<br /> (Not long the inmate of a noble heart)<br />
      He, who before had question'd, thus resum'd:<br /> "O blessed, who, for
      death preparing, tak'st<br /> Experience of our limits, in thy bark!<br />
      Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,<br /> For which, as he did
      triumph, Caesar heard<br /> The snout of 'queen,' to taunt him. &nbsp;Hence
      their cry<br /> Of 'Sodom,' as they parted, to rebuke<br /> Themselves, and

      To tell so much, nor can I. &nbsp;Of myself<br /> Learn what thou wishest.
      &nbsp;Guinicelli I,<br /> Who having truly sorrow'd ere my last,<br />
      Already cleanse me." &nbsp;With such pious joy,<br /> As the two sons upon
      their mother gaz'd<br /> From sad Lycurgus rescu'd, such my joy<br /> (Save
      that I more represt it) when I heard<br /> From his own lips the name of
      him pronounc'd,<br /> Who was a father to me, and to those<br /> My betters,
      who have ever us'd the sweet<br /> And pleasant rhymes of love. &nbsp;So
      nought I heard<br /> Nor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,<br />
      Gazing on him; and, only for the fire,<br /> Approach'd not nearer. &nbsp;When
      my eyes were fed<br /> By looking on him, with such solemn pledge,<br /> As
      forces credence, I devoted me<br /> Unto his service wholly. &nbsp;In reply<br />
      He thus bespake me: "What from thee I hear<br /> Is grav'd so deeply on my
      mind, the waves<br /> Of Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make<br /> A whit
      less lively. &nbsp;But as now thy oath<br /> Has seal'd the truth, declare
      what cause impels<br /> That love, which both thy looks and speech bewray."<br />
      <br />"Those dulcet lays," I answer'd, "which, as long<br /> As of our
      tongue the beauty does not fade,<br /> Shall make us love the very ink that
      trac'd them."<br /> <br />"Brother!" &nbsp;he cried, and pointed at a shade<br />
      Before him, "there is one, whose mother speech<br /> Doth owe to him a
      fairer ornament.<br /> He in love ditties and the tales of prose<br />
      Without a rival stands, and lets the fools<br /> Talk on, who think the
      songster of Limoges<br /> O'ertops him. &nbsp;Rumour and the popular voice<br />
      They look to more than truth, and so confirm<br /> Opinion, ere by art or
      reason taught.<br /> Thus many of the elder time cried up<br /> Guittone,
      giving him the prize, till truth<br /> By strength of numbers vanquish'd.

      way<br /> For one, that follow'd next, when that was said,<br /> He vanish'd
      through the fire, as through the wave<br /> A fish, that glances diving to
      the deep.<br /> <br />I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew<br /> A little
      onward, and besought his name,<br /> For which my heart, I said, kept
      gracious room.<br /> He frankly thus began: "Thy courtesy<br /> So wins on
      me, I have nor power nor will<br /> To hide me. &nbsp;I am Arnault; and
      with songs,<br /> Sorely lamenting for my folly past,<br /> Thorough this

      I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up<br /> Unto the summit of the

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />A little glimpse of sky was seen above;<br /> Yet
      by that little I beheld the stars<br /> In magnitude and rustle shining
      forth<br /> With more than wonted glory. &nbsp;As I lay,<br /> Gazing on
      them, and in that fit of musing,<br /> Sleep overcame me, sleep, that
      bringeth oft<br /> Tidings of future hap. &nbsp;About the hour,<br /> As I
      believe, when Venus from the east<br /> First lighten'd on the mountain,
      she whose orb<br /> Seems always glowing with the fire of love,<br /> A lady
      young and beautiful, I dream'd,<br /> Was passing o'er a lea; and, as she
      came,<br /> Methought I saw her ever and anon<br /> Bending to cull the
      flowers; and thus she sang:<br /> "Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,<br />
      That I am Leah: for my brow to weave<br /> A garland, these fair hands
      unwearied ply.<br /> To please me at the crystal mirror, here<br /> I deck
      me. &nbsp;But my sister Rachel, she<br /> Before her glass abides the
      livelong day,<br /> Her radiant eyes beholding, charm'd no less,<br /> Than
      I with this delightful task. &nbsp;Her joy<br /> In contemplation, as in
      labour mine."<br /> <br />And now as glimm'ring dawn appear'd, that breaks<br />
      More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he<br /> Sojourns less distant on his
      homeward way,<br /> Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled<br /> My
      slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide<br /> Already risen. &nbsp;"That
      delicious fruit,<br /> Which through so many a branch the zealous care<br />
      Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day<br /> Appease thy hunger."
      &nbsp;Such the words I heard<br /> From Virgil's lip; and never greeting
      heard<br /> So pleasant as the sounds. &nbsp;Within me straight<br /> Desire
      so grew upon desire to mount,<br /> Thenceforward at each step I felt the
      wings<br /> Increasing for my flight. &nbsp;When we had run<br /> O'er all
      the ladder to its topmost round,<br /> As there we stood, on me the Mantuan
      fix'd<br /> His eyes, and thus he spake: "Both fires, my son,<br /> The
      temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,<br /> And art arriv'd, where of
      itself my ken<br /> No further reaches. &nbsp;I with skill and art<br />
      Thus far have drawn thee. &nbsp;Now thy pleasure take<br /> For guide.
      &nbsp;Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,<br /> O'ercome the straighter.
      &nbsp;Lo! the sun, that darts<br /> His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the
      herb,<br /> The arboreta and flowers, which of itself<br /> This land pours
      forth profuse! Till those bright eyes<br /> With gladness come, which,
      weeping, made me haste<br /> To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,<br />
      Or wander where thou wilt. &nbsp;Expect no more<br /> Sanction of warning
      voice or sign from me,<br /> Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,<br />
      Discreet, judicious. &nbsp;To distrust thy sense<br /> Were henceforth
      error. &nbsp;I invest thee then<br /> With crown and mitre, sovereign o'er
      thyself." <br /><br /> <a name="link28" id="link28"></a> <br /><br />

      <br /> Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade<br /> With lively
      greenness the new-springing day<br /> Attemper'd, eager now to roam, and
      search<br /> Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,<br /> Along the
      champain leisurely my way<br /> Pursuing, o'er the ground, that on all
      sides<br /> Delicious odour breath'd. &nbsp;A pleasant air,<br /> That
      intermitted never, never veer'd,<br /> Smote on my temples, gently, as a
      wind<br /> Of softest influence: at which the sprays,<br /> Obedient all,
      lean'd trembling to that part<br /> Where first the holy mountain casts his
      shade,<br /> Yet were not so disorder'd, but that still<br /> Upon their top
      the feather'd quiristers<br /> Applied their wonted art, and with full joy<br />
      Welcom'd those hours of prime, and warbled shrill<br /> Amid the leaves,
      that to their jocund lays<br /> inept tenor; even as from branch to branch,<br />
      Along the piney forests on the shore<br /> Of Chiassi, rolls the gath'ring

      ancient wood<br /> Transported me, I could not ken the place<br /> Where I
      had enter'd, when behold! my path<br /> Was bounded by a rill, which to the

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />My feet advanc'd not; but my wond'ring eyes<br />
      Pass'd onward, o'er the streamlet, to survey<br /> The tender May-bloom,
      flush'd through many a hue,<br /> In prodigal variety: and there,<br /> As
      object, rising suddenly to view,<br /> That from our bosom every thought
      beside<br /> With the rare marvel chases, I beheld<br /> A lady all alone,
      who, singing, went,<br /> And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way<br />
      Was all o'er painted. &nbsp;"Lady beautiful!<br /> Thou, who (if looks,
      that use to speak the heart,<br /> Are worthy of our trust), with love's
      own beam<br /> Dost warm thee," thus to her my speech I fram'd:<br /> "Ah!
      please thee hither towards the streamlet bend<br /> Thy steps so near, that
      I may list thy song.<br /> Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,<br />
      I call to mind where wander'd and how look'd<br /> Proserpine, in that
      season, when her child<br /> The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring."<br />
      <br />As when a lady, turning in the dance,<br /> Doth foot it featly, and
      advances scarce<br /> One step before the other to the ground;<br /> Over
      the yellow and vermilion flowers<br /> Thus turn'd she at my suit, most
      maiden-like,<br /> Valing her sober eyes, and came so near,<br /> That I
      distinctly caught the dulcet sound.<br /> Arriving where the limped waters
      now<br /> Lav'd the green sward, her eyes she deign'd to raise,<br /> That
      shot such splendour on me, as I ween<br /> Ne'er glanced from Cytherea's,
      when her son<br /> Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.<br /> Upon the
      opposite bank she stood and smil'd<br /> through her graceful fingers
      shifted still<br /> The intermingling dyes, which without seed<br /> That
      lofty land unbosoms. &nbsp;By the stream<br /> Three paces only were we
      sunder'd: yet<br /> The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass'd it o'er,<br /> (A
      curb for ever to the pride of man)<br /> Was by Leander not more hateful
      held<br /> For floating, with inhospitable wave<br /> 'Twixt Sestus and
      Abydos, than by me<br /> That flood, because it gave no passage thence.<br />
      <br />"Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,<br /> That cradled human
      nature in its birth,<br /> Wond'ring, ye not without suspicion view<br /> My
      smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,<br /> 'Thou, Lord! hast made me
      glad,' will give ye light,<br /> Which may uncloud your minds. &nbsp;And
      thou, who stand'st<br /> The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,<br />
      Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I<br /> Came prompt to answer
      every doubt of thine."<br /> <br />She spake; and I replied: "I know not how<br />
      To reconcile this wave and rustling sound<br /> Of forest leaves, with what
      I late have heard<br /> Of opposite report." &nbsp;She answering thus:<br />
      "I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,<br /> Which makes thee
      wonder; and so purge the cloud<br /> That hath enwraps thee. &nbsp;The
      First Good, whose joy<br /> Is only in himself, created man<br /> For
      happiness, and gave this goodly place,<br /> His pledge and earnest of
      eternal peace.<br /> Favour'd thus highly, through his own defect<br /> He
      fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,<br /> And, for the bitterness
      of sorrow, chang'd<br /> Laughter unblam'd and ever-new delight.<br /> That
      vapours none, exhal'd from earth beneath,<br /> Or from the waters (which,
      wherever heat<br /> Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far<br /> To
      vex man's peaceful state, this mountain rose<br /> So high toward the
      heav'n, nor fears the rage<br /> Of elements contending, from that part<br />
      Exempted, where the gate his limit bars.<br /> Because the circumambient
      air throughout<br /> With its first impulse circles still, unless<br />
      Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;<br /> Upon the summit, which
      on every side<br /> To visitation of th' impassive air<br /> Is open, doth
      that motion strike, and makes<br /> Beneath its sway th' umbrageous wood
      resound:<br /> And in the shaken plant such power resides,<br /> That it
      impregnates with its efficacy<br /> The voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle
      plume<br /> That wafted flies abroad; and th' other land<br /> Receiving (as
      't is worthy in itself,<br /> Or in the clime, that warms it), doth
      conceive,<br /> And from its womb produces many a tree<br /> Of various
      virtue. &nbsp;This when thou hast heard,<br /> The marvel ceases, if in
      yonder earth<br /> Some plant without apparent seed be found<br /> To fix
      its fibrous stem. &nbsp;And further learn,<br /> That with prolific foison
      of all seeds,<br /> This holy plain is fill'd, and in itself<br /> Bears
      fruit that ne'er was pluck'd on other soil.<br /> &nbsp;The water, thou
      behold'st, springs not from vein,<br /> As stream, that intermittently
      repairs<br /> And spends his pulse of life, but issues forth<br /> From
      fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;<br /> And by the will omnific, full
      supply<br /> Feeds whatsoe'er On either side it pours;<br /> On this
      devolv'd with power to take away<br /> Remembrance of offence, on that to
      bring<br /> Remembrance back of every good deed done.<br /> From whence its
      name of Lethe on this part;<br /> On th' other Eunoe: both of which must
      first<br /> Be tasted ere it work; the last exceeding<br /> All flavours
      else. &nbsp;Albeit thy thirst may now<br /> Be well contented, if I here
      break off,<br /> No more revealing: yet a corollary<br /> I freely give
      beside: nor deem my words<br /> Less grateful to thee, if they somewhat
      pass<br /> The stretch of promise. &nbsp;They, whose verse of yore<br /> The
      golden age recorded and its bliss,<br /> On the Parnassian mountain, of
      this place<br /> Perhaps had dream'd. &nbsp;Here was man guiltless, here<br />
      Perpetual spring and every fruit, and this<br /> The far-fam'd nectar."
      &nbsp;Turning to the bards,<br /> When she had ceas'd, I noted in their
      looks<br /> A smile at her conclusion; then my face<br /> Again directed to
      the lovely dame. <br /><br /> <a name="link29" id="link29"></a> <br /><br />

      <br /> Singing, as if enamour'd, she resum'd<br /> And clos'd the song, with
      "Blessed they whose sins<br /> Are cover'd." &nbsp;Like the wood-nymphs
      then, that tripp'd<br /> Singly across the sylvan shadows, one<br /> Eager
      to view and one to 'scape the sun,<br /> So mov'd she on, against the
      current, up<br /> The verdant rivage. &nbsp;I, her mincing step<br />
      Observing, with as tardy step pursued.<br /> <br />Between us not an hundred
      paces trod,<br /> The bank, on each side bending equally,<br /> Gave me to
      face the orient. &nbsp;Nor our way<br /> Far onward brought us, when to me
      at once<br /> She turn'd, and cried: "My brother! look and hearken."<br />
      And lo! a sudden lustre ran across<br /> Through the great forest on all
      parts, so bright<br /> I doubted whether lightning were abroad;<br /> But
      that expiring ever in the spleen,<br /> That doth unfold it, and this
      during still<br /> And waxing still in splendor, made me question<br /> What
      it might be: and a sweet melody<br /> Ran through the luminous air. &nbsp;Then
      did I chide<br /> With warrantable zeal the hardihood<br /> Of our first
      parent, for that there were earth<br /> Stood in obedience to the heav'ns,
      she only,<br /> Woman, the creature of an hour, endur'd not<br /> Restraint
      of any veil: which had she borne<br /> Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,<br />
      Had from the first, and long time since, been mine.<br /> <br />While
      through that wilderness of primy sweets<br /> That never fade, suspense I
      walk'd, and yet<br /> Expectant of beatitude more high,<br /> Before us,
      like a blazing fire, the air<br /> Under the green boughs glow'd; and, for
      a song,<br /> Distinct the sound of melody was heard.<br /> <br />O ye thrice
      holy virgins! for your sakes<br /> If e'er I suffer'd hunger, cold and
      watching,<br /> Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty.<br /> Now through
      my breast let Helicon his stream<br /> Pour copious; and Urania with her
      choir<br /> Arise to aid me: while the verse unfolds<br /> Things that do
      almost mock the grasp of thought.<br /> <br />Onward a space, what seem'd
      seven trees of gold,<br /> The intervening distance to mine eye<br />
      Falsely presented; but when I was come<br /> So near them, that no
      lineament was lost<br /> Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen<br />
      Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,<br /> Then did the faculty, that
      ministers<br /> Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold<br />
      Distinguish, and it th' singing trace the sound<br /> "Hosanna." &nbsp;Above,
      their beauteous garniture<br /> Flam'd with more ample lustre, than the
      moon<br /> Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full.<br /> <br />I
      turn'd me full of wonder to my guide;<br /> And he did answer with a
      countenance<br /> Charg'd with no less amazement: whence my view<br />
      Reverted to those lofty things, which came<br /> So slowly moving towards
      us, that the bride<br /> Would have outstript them on her bridal day.<br />
      <br />The lady called aloud: "Why thus yet burns<br /> Affection in thee for
      these living, lights,<br /> And dost not look on that which follows them?"<br />
      <br />I straightway mark'd a tribe behind them walk,<br /> As if attendant
      on their leaders, cloth'd<br /> With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth<br />
      Was never. &nbsp;On my left, the wat'ry gleam<br /> Borrow'd, and gave me
      back, when there I look'd.<br /> As in a mirror, my left side portray'd.<br />
      <br />When I had chosen on the river's edge<br /> Such station, that the
      distance of the stream<br /> Alone did separate me; there I stay'd<br /> My
      steps for clearer prospect, and beheld<br /> The flames go onward, leaving,
      as they went,<br /> The air behind them painted as with trail<br /> Of

      colours, whence the sun<br /> Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone.<br />
      These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond<br /> My vision; and ten paces,
      as I guess,<br /> Parted the outermost. &nbsp;Beneath a sky<br /> So

      departing, John accords with me.<br /> <br />The space, surrounded by the
      four, enclos'd<br /> A car triumphal: on two wheels it came<br /> Drawn at a
      Gryphon's neck; and he above<br /> Stretch'd either wing uplifted, 'tween
      the midst<br /> And the three listed hues, on each side three;<br /> So that

      circling in smooth dance;<br /> The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce<br />

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> And o'er my Spirit, that in former days<br /> Within
      her presence had abode so long,<br /> No shudd'ring terror crept. &nbsp;Mine
      eyes no more<br /> Had knowledge of her; yet there mov'd from her<br /> A
      hidden virtue, at whose touch awak'd,<br /> The power of ancient love was
      strong within me.<br /> <br />No sooner on my vision streaming, smote<br />
      The heav'nly influence, which years past, and e'en<br /> In childhood,
      thrill'd me, than towards Virgil I<br /> Turn'd me to leftward, panting,
      like a babe,<br /> That flees for refuge to his mother's breast,<br /> If
      aught have terrified or work'd him woe:<br /> And would have cried: "There
      is no dram of blood,<br /> That doth not quiver in me. &nbsp;The old flame<br />
      Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:"<br /> But Virgil had bereav'd us
      of himself,<br /> Virgil, my best-lov'd father; Virgil, he<br /> To whom I
      gave me up for safety: nor,<br /> All, our prime mother lost, avail'd to
      save<br /> My undew'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears.<br /> <br />"Dante,
      weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,<br /> Weep thou not yet: behooves
      thee feel the edge<br /> Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that."<br />
      <br />As to the prow or stern, some admiral<br /> Paces the deck,
      inspiriting his crew,<br /> When 'mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;<br />
      Thus on the left side of the car I saw,<br /> (Turning me at the sound of
      mine own name,<br /> Which here I am compell'd to register)<br /> The virgin
      station'd, who before appeared<br /> Veil'd in that festive shower
      angelical.<br /> <br />Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;<br />
      Though from her brow the veil descending, bound<br /> With foliage of
      Minerva, suffer'd not<br /> That I beheld her clearly; then with act<br />
      Full royal, still insulting o'er her thrall,<br /> Added, as one, who
      speaking keepeth back<br /> The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:<br />
      "Observe me well. &nbsp;I am, in sooth, I am<br /> Beatrice. &nbsp;What!
      and hast thou deign'd at last<br /> Approach the mountain? &nbsp;knewest
      not, O man!<br /> Thy happiness is whole?" &nbsp;Down fell mine eyes<br />
      On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,<br /> Recoil'd, and sought
      the greensward: such a weight<br /> Of shame was on my forehead. &nbsp;With
      a mien<br /> Of that stern majesty, which doth surround<br /> mother's
      presence to her awe-struck child,<br /> She look'd; a flavour of such
      bitterness<br /> Was mingled in her pity. &nbsp;There her words<br /> Brake
      off, and suddenly the angels sang:<br /> "In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope
      hath been:"<br /> But went no farther than, "Thou Lord, hast set<br /> My
      feet in ample room." &nbsp;As snow, that lies<br /> Amidst the living
      rafters on the back<br /> Of Italy congeal'd when drifted high<br /> And
      closely pil'd by rough Sclavonian blasts,<br /> Breathe but the land
      whereon no shadow falls,<br /> And straightway melting it distils away,<br />
      Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,<br /> Without a sigh or tear, or ever
      these<br /> Did sing, that with the chiming of heav'n's sphere,<br /> Still
      in their warbling chime: but when the strain<br /> Of dulcet symphony,
      express'd for me<br /> Their soft compassion, more than could the words<br />
      "Virgin, why so consum'st him?" &nbsp;then the ice,<br /> Congeal'd about
      my bosom, turn'd itself<br /> To spirit and water, and with anguish forth<br />
      Gush'd through the lips and eyelids from the heart.<br /> <br />Upon the
      chariot's right edge still she stood,<br /> Immovable, and thus address'd
      her words<br /> To those bright semblances with pity touch'd:<br /> "Ye in
      th' eternal day your vigils keep,<br /> So that nor night nor slumber, with
      close stealth,<br /> Conveys from you a single step in all<br /> The goings
      on of life: thence with more heed<br /> I shape mine answer, for his ear
      intended,<br /> Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now<br /> May
      equal the transgression. &nbsp;Not alone<br /> Through operation of the
      mighty orbs,<br /> That mark each seed to some predestin'd aim,<br /> As
      with aspect or fortunate or ill<br /> The constellations meet, but through
      benign<br /> Largess of heav'nly graces, which rain down<br /> From such a
      height, as mocks our vision, this man<br /> Was in the freshness of his
      being, such,<br /> So gifted virtually, that in him<br /> All better habits
      wond'rously had thriv'd.<br /> The more of kindly strength is in the soil,<br />
      So much doth evil seed and lack of culture<br /> Mar it the more, and make
      it run to wildness.<br /> These looks sometime upheld him; for I show'd<br />
      My youthful eyes, and led him by their light<br /> In upright walking.
      &nbsp;Soon as I had reach'd<br /> The threshold of my second age, and
      chang'd<br /> My mortal for immortal, then he left me,<br /> And gave
      himself to others. &nbsp;When from flesh<br /> To spirit I had risen, and
      increase<br /> Of beauty and of virtue circled me,<br /> I was less dear to
      him, and valued less.<br /> His steps were turn'd into deceitful ways,<br />
      Following false images of good, that make<br /> No promise perfect. &nbsp;Nor
      avail'd me aught<br /> To sue for inspirations, with the which,<br /> I,
      both in dreams of night, and otherwise,<br /> Did call him back; of them so
      little reck'd him,<br /> Such depth he fell, that all device was short<br />
      Of his preserving, save that he should view<br /> The children of
      perdition. &nbsp;To this end<br /> I visited the purlieus of the dead:<br />
      And one, who hath conducted him thus high,<br /> Receiv'd my supplications
      urg'd with weeping.<br /> It were a breaking of God's high decree,<br /> If
      Lethe should be past, and such food tasted<br /> Without the cost of some
      repentant tear." <br /><br /> <a name="link31" id="link31"></a> <br /><br />

      <br /> "O Thou!" &nbsp;her words she thus without delay<br /> Resuming,
      turn'd their point on me, to whom<br /> They but with lateral edge seem'd
      harsh before,<br /> "Say thou, who stand'st beyond the holy stream,<br /> If
      this be true. &nbsp;A charge so grievous needs<br /> Thine own avowal."
      &nbsp;On my faculty<br /> Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir'd<br />
      Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.<br /> <br />A little space
      refraining, then she spake:<br /> "What dost thou muse on? &nbsp;Answer me.
      &nbsp;The wave<br /> On thy remembrances of evil yet<br /> Hath done no
      injury." &nbsp;A mingled sense<br /> Of fear and of confusion, from my lips<br />
      Did such a "Yea" produce, as needed help<br /> Of vision to interpret.
      &nbsp;As when breaks<br /> In act to be discharg'd, a cross-bow bent<br />
      Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o'erstretch'd,<br /> The flagging
      weapon feebly hits the mark;<br /> Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did
      I burst<br /> Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice<br /> Was slacken'd
      on its way. &nbsp;She straight began:<br /> "When my desire invited thee to
      love<br /> The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,<br /> What bar of
      thwarting foss or linked chain<br /> Did meet thee, that thou so should'st
      quit the hope<br /> Of further progress, or what bait of ease<br /> Or
      promise of allurement led thee on<br /> Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere
      should'st rather wait?"<br /> <br />A bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found
      voice<br /> To answer, hardly to these sounds my lips<br /> Gave utterance,
      wailing: "Thy fair looks withdrawn,<br /> Things present, with deceitful
      pleasures, turn'd<br /> My steps aside." &nbsp;She answering spake: "Hadst
      thou<br /> Been silent, or denied what thou avow'st,<br /> Thou hadst not
      hid thy sin the more: such eye<br /> Observes it. &nbsp;But whene'er the
      sinner's cheek<br /> Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears<br /> Of
      self-accusing, in our court the wheel<br /> Of justice doth run counter to
      the edge.<br /> Howe'er that thou may'st profit by thy shame<br /> For
      errors past, and that henceforth more strength<br /> May arm thee, when
      thou hear'st the Siren-voice,<br /> Lay thou aside the motive to this
      grief,<br /> And lend attentive ear, while I unfold<br /> How opposite a way
      my buried flesh<br /> Should have impell'd thee. &nbsp;Never didst thou spy<br />
      In art or nature aught so passing sweet,<br /> As were the limbs, that in
      their beauteous frame<br /> Enclos'd me, and are scatter'd now in dust.<br />
      If sweetest thing thus fail'd thee with my death,<br /> What, afterward, of
      mortal should thy wish<br /> Have tempted? &nbsp;When thou first hadst felt
      the dart<br /> Of perishable things, in my departing<br /> For better
      realms, thy wing thou should'st have prun'd<br /> To follow me, and never
      stoop'd again<br /> To 'bide a second blow for a slight girl,<br /> Or other
      gaud as transient and as vain.<br /> The new and inexperienc'd bird awaits,<br />
      Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler's aim;<br /> But in the sight of
      one, whose plumes are full,<br /> In vain the net is spread, the arrow
      wing'd."<br /> <br />I stood, as children silent and asham'd<br /> Stand,
      list'ning, with their eyes upon the earth,<br /> Acknowledging their fault
      and self-condemn'd.<br /> And she resum'd: "If, but to hear thus pains
      thee,<br /> Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!"<br /> <br />With
      less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,<br /> Rent from its fibers by a
      blast, that blows<br /> From off the pole, or from Iarbas' land,<br /> Than
      I at her behest my visage rais'd:<br /> And thus the face denoting by the
      beard,<br /> I mark'd the secret sting her words convey'd.<br /> <br />No
      sooner lifted I mine aspect up,<br /> Than downward sunk that vision I
      beheld<br /> Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes<br /> Yet unassur'd
      and wavering, bent their light<br /> On Beatrice. &nbsp;Towards the animal,<br />
      Who joins two natures in one form, she turn'd,<br /> And, even under shadow
      of her veil,<br /> And parted by the verdant rill, that flow'd<br />
      Between, in loveliness appear'd as much<br /> Her former self surpassing,
      as on earth<br /> All others she surpass'd. &nbsp;Remorseful goads<br />
      Shot sudden through me. &nbsp;Each thing else, the more<br /> Its love had
      late beguil'd me, now the more<br /> I Was loathsome. &nbsp;On my heart so
      keenly smote<br /> The bitter consciousness, that on the ground<br />
      O'erpower'd I fell: and what my state was then,<br /> She knows who was the
      cause. &nbsp;When now my strength<br /> Flow'd back, returning outward from
      the heart,<br /> The lady, whom alone I first had seen,<br /> I found above
      me. &nbsp;"Loose me not," she cried:<br /> "Loose not thy hold;" and lo!
      had dragg'd me high<br /> As to my neck into the stream, while she,<br />
      Still as she drew me after, swept along,<br /> Swift as a shuttle, bounding

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />The blessed shore approaching then was heard<br />
      So sweetly, "Tu asperges me," that I<br /> May not remember, much less tell
      the sound.<br /> The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp'd<br /> My
      temples, and immerg'd me, where 't was fit<br /> The wave should drench me:
      and thence raising up,<br /> Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs<br />
      Presented me so lav'd, and with their arm<br /> They each did cover me.
      &nbsp;"Here are we nymphs,<br /> And in the heav'n are stars. &nbsp;Or ever

      tended on her.<br /> We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light<br /> Of
      gladness that is in them, well to scan,<br /> Those yonder three, of deeper

      And then they led me to the Gryphon's breast,<br /> While, turn'd toward
      us, Beatrice stood.<br /> "Spare not thy vision. &nbsp;We have stationed
      thee<br /> Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile<br /> Hath drawn his
      weapons on thee." &nbsp;As they spake,<br /> A thousand fervent wishes
      riveted<br /> Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood<br /> Still fix'd
      toward the Gryphon motionless.<br /> As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus<br />
      Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,<br /> For ever varying, in one
      figure now<br /> Reflected, now in other. &nbsp;Reader! muse<br /> How
      wond'rous in my sight it seem'd to mark<br /> A thing, albeit steadfast in
      itself,<br /> Yet in its imag'd semblance mutable.<br /> <br />Full of amaze,
      and joyous, while my soul<br /> Fed on the viand, whereof still desire<br />
      Grows with satiety, the other three<br /> With gesture, that declar'd a
      loftier line,<br /> Advanc'd: to their own carol on they came<br /> Dancing
      in festive ring angelical.<br /> <br />"Turn, Beatrice!" was their song: "O
      turn<br /> Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,<br /> Who to behold
      thee many a wearisome pace<br /> Hath measur'd. &nbsp;Gracious at our
      pray'r vouchsafe<br /> Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark<br /> Thy

      <br /> Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,<br /> Were bent to rid them of
      their ten years' thirst,<br /> No other sense was waking: and e'en they<br />
      Were fenc'd on either side from heed of aught;<br /> So tangled in its
      custom'd toils that smile<br /> Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,<br />
      When forcibly toward the left my sight<br /> The sacred virgins turn'd; for
      from their lips<br /> I heard the warning sounds: "Too fix'd a gaze!"<br />
      <br />Awhile my vision labor'd; as when late<br /> Upon the' o'erstrained
      eyes the sun hath smote:<br /> But soon to lesser object, as the view<br />
      Was now recover'd (lesser in respect<br /> To that excess of sensible,
      whence late<br /> I had perforce been sunder'd) on their right<br /> I
      mark'd that glorious army wheel, and turn,<br /> Against the sun and
      sev'nfold lights, their front.<br /> As when, their bucklers for protection
      rais'd,<br /> A well-rang'd troop, with portly banners curl'd,<br /> Wheel
      circling, ere the whole can change their ground:<br /> E'en thus the goodly
      regiment of heav'n<br /> Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car<br /> Had
      slop'd his beam. &nbsp;Attendant at the wheels<br /> The damsels turn'd;
      and on the Gryphon mov'd<br /> The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,<br />
      No feather on him trembled. &nbsp;The fair dame<br /> Who through the wave
      had drawn me, companied<br /> By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,<br />
      Whose orbit, rolling, mark'd a lesser arch.<br /> <br />Through the high
      wood, now void (the more her blame,<br /> Who by the serpent was beguil'd)
      I past<br /> With step in cadence to the harmony<br /> Angelic. &nbsp;Onward
      had we mov'd, as far<br /> Perchance as arrow at three several flights<br />
      Full wing'd had sped, when from her station down<br /> Descended Beatrice.
      &nbsp;With one voice<br /> All murmur'd &nbsp;"Adam," circling next a plant<br />
      Despoil'd of flowers and leaf on every bough.<br /> Its tresses, spreading
      more as more they rose,<br /> Were such, as 'midst their forest wilds for
      height<br /> The Indians might have gaz'd at. &nbsp;"Blessed thou!<br />
      Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck'd that tree<br /> Pleasant to taste:
      for hence the appetite<br /> Was warp'd to evil." &nbsp;Round the stately
      trunk<br /> Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return'd<br /> The animal
      twice-gender'd: "Yea: for so<br /> The generation of the just are sav'd."<br />
      And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot<br /> He drew it of the widow'd
      branch, and bound<br /> There left unto the stock whereon it grew.<br />
      <br />As when large floods of radiance from above<br /> Stream, with that
      radiance mingled, which ascends<br /> Next after setting of the scaly sign,<br />
      Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew<br /> His wonted colours, ere
      the sun have yok'd<br /> Beneath another star his flamy steeds;<br /> Thus
      putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,<br /> And deeper than the
      violet, was renew'd<br /> The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare.<br />
      <br />Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose.<br /> I understood it not,
      nor to the end<br /> Endur'd the harmony. &nbsp;Had I the skill<br /> To
      pencil forth, how clos'd th' unpitying eyes<br /> Slumb'ring, when Syrinx
      warbled, (eyes that paid<br /> So dearly for their watching,) then like
      painter,<br /> That with a model paints, I might design<br /> The manner of
      my falling into sleep.<br /> But feign who will the slumber cunningly;<br />
      I pass it by to when I wak'd, and tell<br /> How suddenly a flash of
      splendour rent<br /> The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:<br />
      "Arise, what dost thou?" &nbsp;As the chosen three,<br /> On Tabor's mount,
      admitted to behold<br /> The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit<br />
      Is coveted of angels, and doth make<br /> Perpetual feast in heaven, to
      themselves<br /> Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps<br /> Were
      broken, that they their tribe diminish'd saw,<br /> Both Moses and Elias
      gone, and chang'd<br /> The stole their master wore: thus to myself<br />
      Returning, over me beheld I stand<br /> The piteous one, who cross the
      stream had brought<br /> My steps. &nbsp;"And where," all doubting, I
      exclaim'd,<br /> "Is Beatrice?"&mdash;"See her," she replied,<br /> "Beneath
      the fresh leaf seated on its root.<br /> Behold th' associate choir that
      circles her.<br /> The others, with a melody more sweet<br /> And more
      profound, journeying to higher realms,<br /> Upon the Gryphon tend." &nbsp;If
      there her words<br /> Were clos'd, I know not; but mine eyes had now<br />
      Ta'en view of her, by whom all other thoughts<br /> Were barr'd admittance.
      &nbsp;On the very ground<br /> Alone she sat, as she had there been left<br />
      A guard upon the wain, which I beheld<br /> Bound to the twyform beast.
      &nbsp;The seven nymphs<br /> Did make themselves a cloister round about
      her,<br /> And in their hands upheld those lights secure<br /> From blast
      septentrion and the gusty south.<br /> <br />"A little while thou shalt be
      forester here:<br /> And citizen shalt be forever with me,<br /> Of that
      true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman<br /> To profit the misguided
      world, keep now<br /> Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,<br />
      Take heed thou write, returning to that place."<br /> <br />Thus Beatrice:
      at whose feet inclin'd<br /> Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes,<br />
      I, as she bade, directed. &nbsp;Never fire,<br /> With so swift motion,
      forth a stormy cloud<br /> Leap'd downward from the welkin's farthest
      bound,<br /> As I beheld the bird of Jove descending<br /> Pounce on the
      tree, and, as he rush'd, the rind,<br /> Disparting crush beneath him, buds
      much more<br /> And leaflets. &nbsp;On the car with all his might<br /> He
      struck, whence, staggering like a ship, it reel'd,<br /> At random driv'n,
      to starboard now, o'ercome,<br /> And now to larboard, by the vaulting
      waves.<br /> <br />Next springing up into the chariot's womb<br /> A fox I
      saw, with hunger seeming pin'd<br /> Of all good food. &nbsp;But, for his
      ugly sins<br /> The saintly maid rebuking him, away<br /> Scamp'ring he
      turn'd, fast as his hide-bound corpse<br /> Would bear him. &nbsp;Next,
      from whence before he came,<br /> I saw the eagle dart into the hull<br />
      O' th' car, and leave it with his feathers lin'd;<br /> And then a voice,
      like that which issues forth<br /> From heart with sorrow riv'd, did issue
      forth<br /> From heav'n, and, "O poor bark of mine!" it cried,<br /> "How
      badly art thou freighted!" &nbsp;Then, it seem'd,<br /> That the earth
      open'd between either wheel,<br /> And I beheld a dragon issue thence,<br />
      That through the chariot fix'd his forked train;<br /> And like a wasp that
      draggeth back the sting,<br /> So drawing forth his baleful train, he
      dragg'd<br /> Part of the bottom forth, and went his way<br /> Exulting.
      &nbsp;What remain'd, as lively turf<br /> With green herb, so did clothe
      itself with plumes,<br /> Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind<br />
      Been offer'd; and therewith were cloth'd the wheels,<br /> Both one and
      other, and the beam, so quickly<br /> A sigh were not breath'd sooner.
      &nbsp;Thus transform'd,<br /> The holy structure, through its several
      parts,<br /> Did put forth heads, three on the beam, and one<br /> On every
      side; the first like oxen horn'd,<br /> But with a single horn upon their
      front<br /> The four. &nbsp;Like monster sight hath never seen.<br /> O'er
      it methought there sat, secure as rock<br /> On mountain's lofty top, a
      shameless whore,<br /> Whose ken rov'd loosely round her. &nbsp;At her
      side,<br /> As 't were that none might bear her off, I saw<br /> A giant
      stand; and ever, and anon<br /> They mingled kisses. &nbsp;But, her lustful
      eyes<br /> Chancing on me to wander, that fell minion<br /> Scourg'd her
      from head to foot all o'er; then full<br /> Of jealousy, and fierce with
      rage, unloos'd<br /> The monster, and dragg'd on, so far across<br /> The
      forest, that from me its shades alone<br /> Shielded the harlot and the
      new-form'd brute. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="images/32-148.jpg">ENLARGE

      CANTO XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> "The heathen, Lord! are come!" responsive thus,<br /> The trinal now,
      and now the virgin band<br /> Quaternion, their sweet psalmody began,<br />
      Weeping; and Beatrice listen'd, sad<br /> And sighing, to the song', in
      such a mood,<br /> That Mary, as she stood beside the cross,<br /> Was
      scarce more chang'd. &nbsp;But when they gave her place<br /> To speak,
      then, risen upright on her feet,<br /> She, with a colour glowing bright as
      fire,<br /> Did answer: "Yet a little while, and ye<br /> Shall see me not;
      and, my beloved sisters,<br /> Again a little while, and ye shall see me."<br />
      <br />Before her then she marshall'd all the seven,<br /> And, beck'ning
      only motion'd me, the dame,<br /> And that remaining sage, to follow her.<br />
      <br />So on she pass'd; and had not set, I ween,<br /> Her tenth step to the
      ground, when with mine eyes<br /> Her eyes encounter'd; and, with visage
      mild,<br /> "So mend thy pace," she cried, "that if my words<br /> Address
      thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac'd<br /> To hear them." &nbsp;Soon as
      duly to her side<br /> I now had hasten'd: "Brother!" she began,<br /> "Why
      mak'st thou no attempt at questioning,<br /> As thus we walk together?"
      &nbsp;Like to those<br /> Who, speaking with too reverent an awe<br />
      Before their betters, draw not forth the voice<br /> Alive unto their lips,
      befell me shell<br /> That I in sounds imperfect thus began:<br /> "Lady!
      what I have need of, that thou know'st,<br /> And what will suit my need."
      &nbsp;She answering thus:<br /> "Of fearfulness and shame, I will, that
      thou<br /> Henceforth do rid thee: that thou speak no more,<br /> As one who
      dreams. &nbsp;Thus far be taught of me:<br /> The vessel, which thou saw'st
      the serpent break,<br /> Was and is not: let him, who hath the blame,<br />
      Hope not to scare God's vengeance with a sop.<br /> Without an heir for
      ever shall not be<br /> That eagle, he, who left the chariot plum'd,<br />
      Which monster made it first and next a prey.<br /> Plainly I view, and
      therefore speak, the stars<br /> E'en now approaching, whose conjunction,
      free<br /> From all impediment and bar, brings on<br /> A season, in the
      which, one sent from God,<br /> (Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him
      out)<br /> That foul one, and th' accomplice of her guilt,<br /> The giant,
      both shall slay. &nbsp;And if perchance<br /> My saying, dark as Themis or
      as Sphinx,<br /> Fail to persuade thee, (since like them it foils<br /> The
      intellect with blindness) yet ere long<br /> Events shall be the Naiads,
      that will solve<br /> This knotty riddle, and no damage light<br /> On flock
      or field. &nbsp;Take heed; and as these words<br /> By me are utter'd,
      teach them even so<br /> To those who live that life, which is a race<br />
      To death: and when thou writ'st them, keep in mind<br /> Not to conceal how
      thou hast seen the plant,<br /> That twice hath now been spoil'd. &nbsp;This
      whoso robs,<br /> This whoso plucks, with blasphemy of deed<br /> Sins
      against God, who for his use alone<br /> Creating hallow'd it. &nbsp;For
      taste of this,<br /> In pain and in desire, five thousand years<br /> And
      upward, the first soul did yearn for him,<br /> Who punish'd in himself the
      fatal gust.<br /> <br />"Thy reason slumbers, if it deem this height<br />
      And summit thus inverted of the plant,<br /> Without due cause: and were
      not vainer thoughts,<br /> As Elsa's numbing waters, to thy soul,<br /> And
      their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark<br /> As Pyramus the mulberry,
      thou hadst seen,<br /> In such momentous circumstance alone,<br /> God's
      equal justice morally implied<br /> In the forbidden tree. &nbsp;But since
      I mark thee<br /> In understanding harden'd into stone,<br /> And, to that
      hardness, spotted too and stain'd,<br /> So that thine eye is dazzled at my
      word,<br /> I will, that, if not written, yet at least<br /> Painted thou
      take it in thee, for the cause,<br /> That one brings home his staff
      inwreath'd with palm.<br /> <br />I thus: "As wax by seal, that changeth not<br />
      Its impress, now is stamp'd my brain by thee.<br /> But wherefore soars thy
      wish'd-for speech so high<br /> Beyond my sight, that loses it the more,<br />
      The more it strains to reach it?"&mdash;"To the end<br /> That thou mayst
      know," she answer'd straight, "the school,<br /> That thou hast follow'd;
      and how far behind,<br /> When following my discourse, its learning halts:<br />
      And mayst behold your art, from the divine<br /> As distant, as the
      disagreement is<br /> 'Twixt earth and heaven's most high and rapturous
      orb."<br /> <br />"I not remember," I replied, "that e'er<br /> I was
      estrang'd from thee, nor for such fault<br /> Doth conscience chide me."
      &nbsp;Smiling she return'd:<br /> "If thou canst, not remember, call to
      mind<br /> How lately thou hast drunk of Lethe's wave;<br /> And, sure as
      smoke doth indicate a flame,<br /> In that forgetfulness itself conclude<br />
      Blame from thy alienated will incurr'd.<br /> From henceforth verily my
      words shall be<br /> As naked as will suit them to appear<br /> In thy
      unpractis'd view." &nbsp;More sparkling now,<br /> And with retarded course
      the sun possess'd<br /> The circle of mid-day, that varies still<br /> As
      th' aspect varies of each several clime,<br /> When, as one, sent in vaward
      of a troop<br /> For escort, pauses, if perchance he spy<br /> Vestige of
      somewhat strange and rare: so paus'd<br /> The sev'nfold band, arriving at
      the verge<br /> Of a dun umbrage hoar, such as is seen,<br /> Beneath green
      leaves and gloomy branches, oft<br /> To overbrow a bleak and alpine cliff.<br />
      And, where they stood, before them, as it seem'd,<br /> Tigris and
      Euphrates both beheld,<br /> Forth from one fountain issue; and, like
      friends,<br /> Linger at parting. "O enlight'ning beam!<br /> O glory of our
      kind! beseech thee say<br /> What water this, which from one source deriv'd<br />
      Itself removes to distance from itself?"<br /> <br />To such entreaty answer
      thus was made:<br /> "Entreat Matilda, that she teach thee this."<br />
      <br />And here, as one, who clears himself of blame<br /> Imputed, the fair
      dame return'd: "Of me<br /> He this and more hath learnt; and I am safe<br />
      That Lethe's water hath not hid it from him."<br /> <br />And Beatrice:
      "Some more pressing care<br /> That oft the memory 'reeves, perchance hath
      made<br /> His mind's eye dark. &nbsp;But lo! where Eunoe cows!<br /> Lead
      thither; and, as thou art wont, revive<br /> His fainting virtue." &nbsp;As
      a courteous spirit,<br /> That proffers no excuses, but as soon<br /> As he
      hath token of another's will,<br /> Makes it his own; when she had ta'en
      me, thus<br /> The lovely maiden mov'd her on, and call'd<br /> To Statius
      with an air most lady-like:<br /> "Come thou with him." &nbsp;Were further
      space allow'd,<br /> Then, Reader, might I sing, though but in part,<br />
      That beverage, with whose sweetness I had ne'er<br /> Been sated. &nbsp;But,
      since all the leaves are full,<br /> Appointed for this second strain, mine
      art<br /> With warning bridle checks me. &nbsp;I return'd<br /> From the

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
