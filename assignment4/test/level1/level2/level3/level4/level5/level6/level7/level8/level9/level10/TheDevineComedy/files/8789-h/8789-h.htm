      <br /><br /><br /><br /> IN the midway of this our mortal life,<br /> I found
      me in a gloomy wood, astray<br /> Gone from the path direct: and e'en to
      tell<br /> It were no easy task, how savage wild<br /> That forest, how
      robust and rough its growth,<br /> Which to remember only, my dismay<br />
      Renews, in bitterness not far from death.<br /> Yet to discourse of what
      there good befell,<br /> All else will I relate discover'd there.<br /> How
      first I enter'd it I scarce can say,<br /> Such sleepy dullness in that
      instant weigh'd<br /> My senses down, when the true path I left,<br /> But
      when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd<br /> The valley, that had
      pierc'd my heart with dread,<br /> I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders
      broad<br /> Already vested with that planet's beam,<br /> Who leads all
      wanderers safe through every way.<br /> <br />Then was a little respite to
      the fear,<br /> That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,<br /> All of that
      night, so pitifully pass'd:<br /> And as a man, with difficult short
      breath,<br /> Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,<br /> Turns
      to the perilous wide waste, and stands<br /> At gaze; e'en so my spirit,
      that yet fail'd<br /> Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,<br />
      That none hath pass'd and liv'd. &nbsp;My weary frame<br /> After short
      pause recomforted, again<br /> I journey'd on over that lonely steep,<br />
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="images/01-005.jpg">ENLARGE TO FULL SIZE</a>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> The hinder foot still firmer. &nbsp;Scarce the ascent<br />
      Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,<br /> And cover'd with a
      speckled skin, appear'd,<br /> Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove<br />
      To check my onward going; that ofttimes<br /> With purpose to retrace my
      steps I turn'd.<br /> <br />The hour was morning's prime, and on his way<br />
      Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,<br /> That with him rose, when
      Love divine first mov'd<br /> Those its fair works: so that with joyous
      hope<br /> All things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin<br /> Of that swift
      animal, the matin dawn<br /> And the sweet season. &nbsp;Soon that joy was
      chas'd,<br /> And by new dread succeeded, when in view<br /> A lion came,
      'gainst me, as it appear'd,<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,<br /> That
      e'en the air was fear-struck. &nbsp;A she-wolf<br /> Was at his heels, who
      in her leanness seem'd<br /> Full of all wants, and many a land hath made<br />
      Disconsolate ere now. &nbsp;She with such fear<br /> O'erwhelmed me, at the
      sight of her appall'd,<br /> That of the height all hope I lost. &nbsp;As
      one,<br /> Who with his gain elated, sees the time<br /> When all unwares is
      gone, he inwardly<br /> Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,<br />
      Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,<br /> Who coming o'er against
      me, by degrees<br /> Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.<br /> <br />While
      to the lower space with backward step<br /> I fell, my ken discern'd the
      form one of one,<br /> Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of
      speech.<br /> When him in that great desert I espied,<br /> "Have mercy on
      me!" &nbsp;cried I out aloud,<br /> "Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou
      be!"<br /> <br />He answer'd: "Now not man, man once I was,<br /> And born of
      Lombard parents, Mantuana both<br /> By country, when the power of Julius
      yet<br /> Was scarcely firm. &nbsp;At Rome my life was past<br /> Beneath
      the mild Augustus, in the time<br /> Of fabled deities and false. &nbsp;A
      bard<br /> Was I, and made Anchises' upright son<br /> The subject of my
      song, who came from Troy,<br /> When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty
      towers.<br /> But thou, say wherefore to such perils past<br /> Return'st
      thou? &nbsp;wherefore not this pleasant mount<br /> Ascendest, cause and
      source of all delight?"<br /> "And art thou then that Virgil, that
      well-spring,<br /> From which such copious floods of eloquence<br /> Have
      issued?" &nbsp;I with front abash'd replied.<br /> "Glory and light of all
      the tuneful train!<br /> May it avail me that I long with zeal<br /> Have
      sought thy volume, and with love immense<br /> Have conn'd it o'er. &nbsp;My
      master thou and guide!<br /> Thou he from whom alone I have deriv'd<br />
      That style, which for its beauty into fame<br /> Exalts me. &nbsp;See the
      beast, from whom I fled.<br /> O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!<br />

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> "For every vein and pulse throughout my frame<br />
      She hath made tremble." &nbsp;He, soon as he saw<br /> That I was weeping,
      answer'd, "Thou must needs<br /> Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape<br />
      From out that savage wilderness. &nbsp;This beast,<br /> At whom thou
      criest, her way will suffer none<br /> To pass, and no less hindrance makes
      than death:<br /> So bad and so accursed in her kind,<br /> That never sated
      is her ravenous will,<br /> Still after food more craving than before.<br />
      To many an animal in wedlock vile<br /> She fastens, and shall yet to many
      more,<br /> Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy<br /> Her with
      sharp pain. &nbsp;He will not life support<br /> By earth nor its base
      metals, but by love,<br /> Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be<br />
      The land 'twixt either Feltro. &nbsp;In his might<br /> Shall safety to
      Italia's plains arise,<br /> For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,<br />
      Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.<br /> He with incessant chase through
      every town<br /> Shall worry, until he to hell at length<br /> Restore her,
      thence by envy first let loose.<br /> I for thy profit pond'ring now
      devise,<br /> That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide<br /> Will lead
      thee hence through an eternal space,<br /> Where thou shalt hear despairing
      shrieks, and see<br /> Spirits of old tormented, who invoke<br /> A second
      death; and those next view, who dwell<br /> Content in fire, for that they
      hope to come,<br /> Whene'er the time may be, among the blest,<br /> Into
      whose regions if thou then desire<br /> T' ascend, a spirit worthier then I<br />
      Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,<br /> Thou shalt be left:
      for that Almighty King,<br /> Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,<br />
      Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,<br /> That to his city none
      through me should come.<br /> He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there
      holds<br /> His citadel and throne. &nbsp;O happy those,<br /> Whom there he
      chooses!" I to him in few:<br /> "Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not
      adore,<br /> I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse<br /> I may escape)
      to lead me, where thou saidst,<br /> That I Saint Peter's gate may view,
      and those<br /> Who as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight."<br /> <br />Onward
      he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> NOW was the day departing, and the air,<br />
      Imbrown'd with shadows, from their toils releas'd<br /> All animals on
      earth; and I alone<br /> Prepar'd myself the conflict to sustain,<br /> Both
      of sad pity, and that perilous road,<br /> Which my unerring memory shall
      retrace.<br /> <br />O Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe<br /> Your aid! O
      mind! that all I saw hast kept<br /> Safe in a written record, here thy
      worth<br /> And eminent endowments come to proof.<br /> <br />I thus began:
      "Bard! thou who art my guide,<br /> Consider well, if virtue be in me<br />
      Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise<br /> Thou trust me. &nbsp;Thou
      hast told that Silvius' sire,<br /> Yet cloth'd in corruptible flesh, among<br />
      Th' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there<br /> Sensible present.
      &nbsp;Yet if heaven's great Lord,<br /> Almighty foe to ill, such favour
      shew'd,<br /> In contemplation of the high effect,<br /> Both what and who
      from him should issue forth,<br /> It seems in reason's judgment well
      deserv'd:<br /> Sith he of Rome, and of Rome's empire wide,<br /> In
      heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire:<br /> Both which, if truth be
      spoken, were ordain'd<br /> And 'stablish'd for the holy place, where sits<br />
      Who to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds.<br /> He from this journey, in
      thy song renown'd,<br /> Learn'd things, that to his victory gave rise<br />
      And to the papal robe. &nbsp;In after-times<br /> The chosen vessel also
      travel'd there,<br /> To bring us back assurance in that faith,<br /> Which
      is the entrance to salvation's way.<br /> But I, why should I there
      presume? &nbsp;or who<br /> Permits it? &nbsp;not, Aeneas I nor Paul.<br />
      Myself I deem not worthy, and none else<br /> Will deem me. &nbsp;I, if on
      this voyage then<br /> I venture, fear it will in folly end.<br /> Thou, who
      art wise, better my meaning know'st,<br /> Than I can speak." &nbsp;As one,
      who unresolves<br /> What he hath late resolv'd, and with new thoughts<br />
      Changes his purpose, from his first intent<br /> Remov'd; e'en such was I
      on that dun coast,<br /> Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first<br /> So
      eagerly embrac'd. &nbsp;"If right thy words<br /> I scan," replied that
      shade magnanimous,<br /> "Thy soul is by vile fear assail'd, which oft<br />
      So overcasts a man, that he recoils<br /> From noblest resolution, like a
      beast<br /> At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.<br /> That from
      this terror thou mayst free thyself,<br /> I will instruct thee why I came,
      and what<br /> I heard in that same instant, when for thee<br /> Grief
      touch'd me first. &nbsp;I was among the tribe,<br /> Who rest suspended,
      when a dame, so blest<br /> And lovely, I besought her to command,<br />
      Call'd me; her eyes were brighter than the star<br /> Of day; and she with
      gentle voice and soft<br /> Angelically tun'd her speech address'd:<br /> "O
      courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame<br /> Yet lives, and shall live
      long as nature lasts!<br /> A friend, not of my fortune but myself,<br /> On
      the wide desert in his road has met<br /> Hindrance so great, that he
      through fear has turn'd.<br /> Now much I dread lest he past help have
      stray'd,<br /> And I be ris'n too late for his relief,<br /> From what in
      heaven of him I heard. &nbsp;Speed now,<br /> And by thy eloquent
      persuasive tongue,<br /> And by all means for his deliverance meet,<br />

      pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four<br /> syllables, of which
      the third is a long one.) Revisited with joy. &nbsp;Love brought me

      excels whatever is contain'd<br /> Within that heaven which hath the
      smallest orb,<br /> So thy command delights me, that to obey,<br /> If it
      were done already, would seem late.<br /> No need hast thou farther to
      speak thy will;<br /> Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth<br /> To
      leave that ample space, where to return<br /> Thou burnest, for this centre
      here beneath."<br /> <br />She then: "Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,<br />
      I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread<br /> Hinders my entrance here.
      &nbsp;Those things alone<br /> Are to be fear'd, whence evil may proceed,<br />
      None else, for none are terrible beside.<br /> I am so fram'd by God,
      thanks to his grace!<br /> That any suff'rance of your misery<br /> Touches
      me not, nor flame of that fierce fire<br /> Assails me. &nbsp;In high
      heaven a blessed dame<br /> Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief<br />
      That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,<br /> That God's stern
      judgment to her will inclines."<br /> To Lucia calling, her she thus
      bespake:<br /> "Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid<br /> And I
      commend him to thee." &nbsp;At her word<br /> Sped Lucia, of all cruelty
      the foe,<br /> And coming to the place, where I abode<br /> Seated with
      Rachel, her of ancient days,<br /> She thus address'd me: "Thou true praise
      of God!<br /> Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent<br /> To him, who so
      much lov'd thee, as to leave<br /> For thy sake all the multitude admires?<br />
      Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,<br /> Nor mark the death, which in
      the torrent flood,<br /> Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?"<br />
      Ne'er among men did any with such speed<br /> Haste to their profit, flee
      from their annoy,<br /> As when these words were spoken, I came here,<br />
      Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force<br /> Of thy pure eloquence,
      which thee, and all<br /> Who well have mark'd it, into honour brings."<br />
      <br />"When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes<br /> Tearful she turn'd
      aside; whereat I felt<br /> Redoubled zeal to serve thee. &nbsp;As she
      will'd,<br /> Thus am I come: I sav'd thee from the beast,<br /> Who thy
      near way across the goodly mount<br /> Prevented. &nbsp;What is this comes
      o'er thee then?<br /> Why, why dost thou hang back? &nbsp;why in thy breast<br />
      Harbour vile fear? &nbsp;why hast not courage there<br /> And noble daring?
      &nbsp;Since three maids so blest<br /> Thy safety plan, e'en in the court
      of heaven;<br /> And so much certain good my words forebode."<br /> <br />As
      florets, by the frosty air of night<br /> Bent down and clos'd, when day
      has blanch'd their leaves,<br /> Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;<br />
      So was my fainting vigour new restor'd,<br /> And to my heart such kindly
      courage ran,<br /> That I as one undaunted soon replied:<br /> "O full of
      pity she, who undertook<br /> My succour! and thou kind who didst perform<br />
      So soon her true behest! With such desire<br /> Thou hast dispos'd me to
      renew my voyage,<br /> That my first purpose fully is resum'd.<br /> Lead
      on: one only will is in us both.<br /> Thou art my guide, my master thou,
      and lord."<br /> <br />So spake I; and when he had onward mov'd,<br /> I

      had stretch'd forth<br /> To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was
      cheer'd,<br /> Into that secret place he led me on.<br /> <br />Here sighs
      with lamentations and loud moans<br /> Resounded through the air pierc'd by
      no star,<br /> That e'en I wept at entering. &nbsp;Various tongues,<br />
      Horrible languages, outcries of woe,<br /> Accents of anger, voices deep
      and hoarse,<br /> With hands together smote that swell'd the sounds,<br />
      Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls<br /> Round through that air with
      solid darkness stain'd,<br /> Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.<br />
      <br />I then, with error yet encompass'd, cried:<br /> "O master! &nbsp;What
      is this I hear? &nbsp;What race<br /> Are these, who seem so overcome with
      woe?"<br /> <br />He thus to me: "This miserable fate<br /> Suffer the
      wretched souls of those, who liv'd<br /> Without or praise or blame, with
      that ill band<br /> Of angels mix'd, who nor rebellious prov'd<br /> Nor yet
      were true to God, but for themselves<br /> Were only. &nbsp;From his bounds
      Heaven drove them forth,<br /> Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth<br />
      Of Hell receives them, lest th' accursed tribe<br /> Should glory thence
      with exultation vain."<br /> <br />I then: "Master! what doth aggrieve them
      thus,<br /> That they lament so loud?" &nbsp;He straight replied:<br />
      "That will I tell thee briefly. &nbsp;These of death<br /> No hope may
      entertain: and their blind life<br /> So meanly passes, that all other lots<br />
      They envy. &nbsp;Fame of them the world hath none,<br /> Nor suffers; mercy
      and justice scorn them both.<br /> Speak not of them, but look, and pass
      them by."<br /> <br />And I, who straightway look'd, beheld a flag,<br />
      Which whirling ran around so rapidly,<br /> That it no pause obtain'd: and
      following came<br /> Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er<br /> Have
      thought, that death so many had despoil'd.<br /> <br />When some of these I
      recogniz'd, I saw<br /> And knew the shade of him, who to base fear<br />
      Yielding, abjur'd his high estate. &nbsp;Forthwith<br /> I understood for
      certain this the tribe<br /> Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing<br />
      And to his foes. &nbsp;These wretches, who ne'er lived,<br /> Went on in
      nakedness, and sorely stung<br /> By wasps and hornets, which bedew'd their
      cheeks<br /> With blood, that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet,<br />
      And by disgustful worms was gather'd there.<br /> <br />Then looking farther
      onwards I beheld<br /> A throng upon the shore of a great stream:<br />

      Fearing my words offensive to his ear,<br /> Till we had reach'd the river,

      beheld<br /> I left them not, "By other way," said he,<br /> "By other haven
      shalt thou come to shore,<br /> Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat<br />

      <br /> BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash<br /> Of heavy thunder,
      that I shook myself,<br /> As one by main force rous'd. &nbsp;Risen
      upright,<br /> My rested eyes I mov'd around, and search'd<br /> With fixed
      ken to know what place it was,<br /> Wherein I stood. &nbsp;For certain on
      the brink<br /> I found me of the lamentable vale,<br /> The dread abyss,
      that joins a thund'rous sound<br /> Of plaints innumerable. &nbsp;Dark and
      deep,<br /> And thick with clouds o'erspread, mine eye in vain<br />
      Explor'd its bottom, nor could aught discern.<br /> <br />"Now let us to the
      blind world there beneath<br /> Descend;" the bard began all pale of look:<br />
      "I go the first, and thou shalt follow next."<br /> <br />Then I his alter'd
      hue perceiving, thus:<br /> "How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,<br />
      Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?"<br /> <br />He then: "The
      anguish of that race below<br /> With pity stains my cheek, which thou for
      fear<br /> Mistakest. &nbsp;Let us on. &nbsp;Our length of way<br /> Urges
      to haste." &nbsp;Onward, this said, he mov'd;<br /> And ent'ring led me
      with him on the bounds<br /> Of the first circle, that surrounds th' abyss.<br />
      Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard<br /> Except of sighs,
      that made th' eternal air<br /> Tremble, not caus'd by tortures, but from
      grief<br /> Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,<br /> Of men, women,
      and infants. &nbsp;Then to me<br /> The gentle guide: "Inquir'st thou not
      what spirits<br /> Are these, which thou beholdest? &nbsp;Ere thou pass<br />
      Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin<br /> Were blameless; and if

      well I knew<br /> Suspended in that Limbo many a soul<br /> Of mighty worth.
      &nbsp;"O tell me, sire rever'd!<br /> Tell me, my master!" &nbsp;I began
      through wish<br /> Of full assurance in that holy faith,<br /> Which
      vanquishes all error; "say, did e'er<br /> Any, or through his own or
      other's merit,<br /> Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?"<br />
      <br />Piercing the secret purport of my speech,<br /> He answer'd: "I was
      new to that estate,<br /> When I beheld a puissant one arrive<br /> Amongst
      us, with victorious trophy crown'd.<br /> He forth the shade of our first
      parent drew,<br /> Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,<br /> Of Moses

      Israel with his sire and with his sons,<br /> Nor without Rachel whom so
      hard he won,<br /> And others many more, whom he to bliss<br /> Exalted.
      &nbsp;Before these, be thou assur'd,<br /> No spirit of human kind was ever
      sav'd."<br /> <br />We, while he spake, ceas'd not our onward road,<br />
      Still passing through the wood; for so I name<br /> Those spirits thick
      beset. &nbsp;We were not far<br /> On this side from the summit, when I
      kenn'd<br /> A flame, that o'er the darken'd hemisphere<br /> Prevailing
      shin'd. &nbsp;Yet we a little space<br /> Were distant, not so far but I in
      part<br /> Discover'd, that a tribe in honour high<br /> That place
      possess'd. &nbsp;"O thou, who every art<br /> And science valu'st! who are
      these, that boast<br /> Such honour, separate from all the rest?"<br />
      <br />He answer'd: "The renown of their great names<br /> That echoes
      through your world above, acquires<br /> Favour in heaven, which holds them
      thus advanc'd."<br /> Meantime a voice I heard: "Honour the bard<br />
      Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!"<br /> No sooner ceas'd the
      sound, than I beheld<br /> Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,<br />
      Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.<br /> <br />When thus my master
      kind began: "Mark him,<br /> Who in his right hand bears that falchion
      keen,<br /> The other three preceding, as their lord.<br /> This is that
      Homer, of all bards supreme:<br /> Flaccus the next in satire's vein

      the monarch of sublimest song,<br /> That o'er the others like an eagle
      soars.<br /> When they together short discourse had held,<br /> They turn'd
      to me, with salutation kind<br /> Beck'ning me; at the which my master
      smil'd:<br /> Nor was this all; but greater honour still<br /> They gave me,
      for they made me of their tribe;<br /> And I was sixth amid so learn'd a

      matters, then befitting well<br /> To speak, now fitter left untold. &nbsp;At
      foot<br /> Of a magnificent castle we arriv'd,<br /> Seven times with lofty
      walls begirt, and round<br /> Defended by a pleasant stream. &nbsp;O'er
      this<br /> As o'er dry land we pass'd. &nbsp;Next through seven gates<br />
      I with those sages enter'd, and we came<br /> Into a mead with lively
      verdure fresh.<br /> <br />There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around<br />
      Majestically mov'd, and in their port<br /> Bore eminent authority; they
      spake<br /> Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.<br /> <br />We to
      one side retir'd, into a place<br /> Open and bright and lofty, whence each
      one<br /> Stood manifest to view. &nbsp;Incontinent<br /> There on the green
      enamel of the plain<br /> Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight<br />
      I am exalted in my own esteem.<br /> <br />Electra there I saw accompanied<br />
      By many, among whom Hector I knew,<br /> Anchises' pious son, and with

      &nbsp;On the other side<br /> Old King Latinus, seated by his child<br />
      Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,<br /> Who Tarquin chas'd, Lucretia,
      Cato's wife<br /> Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;<br /> And sole
      apart retir'd, the Soldan fierce.<br /> <br />Then when a little more I
      rais'd my brow,<br /> I spied the master of the sapient throng,<br /> Seated
      amid the philosophic train.<br /> Him all admire, all pay him rev'rence
      due.<br /> There Socrates and Plato both I mark'd,<br /> Nearest to him in
      rank; Democritus,<br /> Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,<br /> With
      Heraclitus, and Empedocles,<br /> And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,<br />
      Zeno, and Dioscorides well read<br /> In nature's secret lore. &nbsp;Orpheus

      vast, Averroes.<br /> <br />Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;<br />
      For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes<br /> My words fall short of what
      bechanc'd. &nbsp;In two<br /> The six associates part. &nbsp;Another way<br />

      hell<br /> With restless fury drives the spirits on<br /> Whirl'd round and

      shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,<br /> And blasphemies 'gainst
      the good Power in heaven.<br /> <br />I understood that to this torment sad<br />
      The carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom<br /> Reason by lust is sway'd.
      &nbsp;As in large troops<br /> And multitudinous, when winter reigns,<br />

      gust those evil souls.<br /> On this side and on that, above, below,<br />
      It drives them: hope of rest to solace them<br /> Is none, nor e'en of
      milder pang. &nbsp;As cranes,<br /> Chanting their dol'rous notes, traverse
      the sky,<br /> Stretch'd out in long array: so I beheld<br /> Spirits, who
      came loud wailing, hurried on<br /> By their dire doom. &nbsp;Then I:
      "Instructor! who<br /> Are these, by the black air so scourg'd?"&mdash;"The
      first<br /> 'Mong those, of whom thou question'st," he replied,<br /> "O'er
      many tongues was empress. &nbsp;She in vice<br /> Of luxury was so
      shameless, that she made<br /> Liking be lawful by promulg'd decree,<br />

      and beside<br /> A thousand more he show'd me, and by name<br /> Pointed
      them out, whom love bereav'd of life.<br /> <br />When I had heard my sage

      By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind<br /> Was lost; and I began: "Bard!
      willingly<br /> I would address those two together coming,<br /> Which seem
      so light before the wind." &nbsp;He thus:<br /> "Note thou, when nearer

      Entreat; and they will come." &nbsp;Soon as the wind<br /> Sway'd them
      toward us, I thus fram'd my speech:<br /> "O wearied spirits! come, and
      hold discourse<br /> With us, if by none else restrain'd." &nbsp;As doves<br />
      By fond desire invited, on wide wings<br /> And firm, to their sweet nest

      speeding; with such force<br /> My cry prevail'd by strong affection urg'd.<br />
      <br />"O gracious creature and benign! who go'st<br /> Visiting, through

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> "Love brought us to one death: Caina waits<br /> The
      soul, who spilt our life." &nbsp;Such were their words;<br /> At hearing
      which downward I bent my looks,<br /> And held them there so long, that the
      bard cried:<br /> "What art thou pond'ring?" &nbsp;I in answer thus:<br />
      "Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire<br /> Must they at length
      to that ill pass have reach'd!"<br /> <br />Then turning, I to them my
      speech address'd.<br /> And thus began: "Francesca! your sad fate<br /> Even
      to tears my grief and pity moves.<br /> But tell me; in the time of your
      sweet sighs,<br /> By what, and how love granted, that ye knew<br /> Your
      yet uncertain wishes?" &nbsp;She replied:<br /> "No greater grief than to
      remember days<br /> Of joy, when mis'ry is at hand! That kens<br /> Thy
      learn'd instructor. &nbsp;Yet so eagerly<br /> If thou art bent to know the
      primal root,<br /> From whence our love gat being, I will do,<br /> As one,
      who weeps and tells his tale. &nbsp;One day<br /> For our delight we read
      of Lancelot,<br /> How him love thrall'd. &nbsp;Alone we were, and no<br />
      Suspicion near us. &nbsp;Ofttimes by that reading<br /> Our eyes were drawn
      together, and the hue<br /> Fled from our alter'd cheek. &nbsp;But at one
      point<br /> Alone we fell. &nbsp;When of that smile we read,<br /> The
      wished smile, rapturously kiss'd<br /> By one so deep in love, then he, who
      ne'er<br /> From me shall separate, at once my lips<br /> All trembling
      kiss'd. &nbsp;The book and writer both<br /> Were love's purveyors. &nbsp;In
      its leaves that day<br /> We read no more." &nbsp;While thus one spirit
      spake,<br /> The other wail'd so sorely, that heartstruck<br /> I through
      compassion fainting, seem'd not far<br /> From death, and like a corpse
      fell to the ground. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="images/05-061.jpg">ENLARGE

      Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd<br /> For ever, both in

      Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain:<br /> Stank all the land

      fatigue am worn;<br /> Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these<br /> Have
      by like crime incurr'd like punishment."<br /> <br />No more he said, and I
      my speech resum'd:<br /> "Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,<br />
      Even to tears. &nbsp;But tell me, if thou know'st,<br /> What shall at
      length befall the citizens<br /> Of the divided city; whether any just one<br />
      Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,<br /> Whence jarring discord hath
      assail'd it thus?"<br /> <br />He then: "After long striving they will come<br />
      To blood; and the wild party from the woods<br /> Will chase the other with
      much injury forth.<br /> Then it behoves, that this must fall, within<br />
      Three solar circles; and the other rise<br /> By borrow'd force of one, who
      under shore<br /> Now rests. &nbsp;It shall a long space hold aloof<br />

      number,<br /> But they neglected. &nbsp;Av'rice, envy, pride,<br /> Three
      fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all<br /> On fire." &nbsp;Here ceas'd
      the lamentable sound;<br /> And I continu'd thus: "Still would I learn<br />
      More from thee, farther parley still entreat.<br /> Of Farinata and
      Tegghiaio say,<br /> They who so well deserv'd, of Giacopo,<br /> Arrigo,
      Mosca, and the rest, who bent<br /> Their minds on working good. &nbsp;Oh!
      tell me where<br /> They bide, and to their knowledge let me come.<br /> For
      I am press'd with keen desire to hear,<br /> If heaven's sweet cup or
      poisonous drug of hell<br /> Be to their lip assign'd." &nbsp;&nbsp;He
      answer'd straight:<br /> "These are yet blacker spirits. &nbsp;Various
      crimes<br /> Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.<br /> If thou so far
      descendest, thou mayst see them.<br /> But to the pleasant world when thou
      return'st,<br /> Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there.<br /> No more I
      tell thee, answer thee no more."<br /> <br />This said, his fixed eyes he
      turn'd askance,<br /> A little ey'd me, then bent down his head,<br /> And
      'midst his blind companions with it fell.<br /> <br />When thus my guide:
      "No more his bed he leaves,<br /> Ere the last angel-trumpet blow. &nbsp;The
      Power<br /> Adverse to these shall then in glory come,<br /> Each one
      forthwith to his sad tomb repair,<br /> Resume his fleshly vesture and his
      form,<br /> And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend<br /> The vault."
      &nbsp;So pass'd we through that mixture foul<br /> Of spirits and rain,
      with tardy steps; meanwhile<br /> Touching, though slightly, on the life to
      come.<br /> For thus I question'd: "Shall these tortures, Sir!<br /> When
      the great sentence passes, be increas'd,<br /> Or mitigated, or as now
      severe?"<br /> <br />He then: "Consult thy knowledge; that decides<br /> That
      as each thing to more perfection grows,<br /> It feels more sensibly both
      good and pain.<br /> Though ne'er to true perfection may arrive<br /> This
      race accurs'd, yet nearer then than now<br /> They shall approach it."
      &nbsp;Compassing that path<br /> Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse<br />
      Much more than I relate between us pass'd:<br /> Till at the point, where

      that underneath<br /> The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs<br /> Into
      these bubbles make the surface heave,<br /> As thine eye tells thee
      wheresoe'er it turn.<br /> Fix'd in the slime they say: 'Sad once were we<br />
      In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,<br /> Carrying a foul and lazy
      mist within:<br /> Now in these murky settlings are we sad.'<br /> Such
      dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.<br /> But word distinct can
      utter none." &nbsp;Our route<br /> Thus compass'd we, a segment widely
      stretch'd<br /> Between the dry embankment, and the core<br /> Of the
      loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes<br /> Downward on those who gulp'd
      its muddy lees;<br /> Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.

      <br /> MY theme pursuing, I relate that ere<br /> We reach'd the lofty
      turret's base, our eyes<br /> Its height ascended, where two cressets hung<br />
      We mark'd, and from afar another light<br /> Return the signal, so remote,
      that scarce<br /> The eye could catch its beam. &nbsp;I turning round<br />
      To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd:<br /> "Say what this means?
      &nbsp;and what that other light<br /> In answer set? &nbsp;what agency doth
      this?"<br /> <br />"There on the filthy waters," he replied,<br /> "E'en now
      what next awaits us mayst thou see,<br /> If the marsh-gender'd fog conceal
      it not."<br /> <br />Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd,<br /> That ran
      its way so nimbly through the air,<br /> As a small bark, that through the
      waves I spied<br /> Toward us coming, under the sole sway<br /> Of one that
      ferried it, who cried aloud:<br /> "Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?"&mdash;"Phlegyas,
      Phlegyas,<br /> This time thou criest in vain," my lord replied;<br /> "No
      longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er<br /> The slimy pool we pass."
      &nbsp;As one who hears<br /> Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat<br />

      Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd<br /> The vessel freighted.

      neck<br /> Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: "O soul<br /> Justly
      disdainful! blest was she in whom<br /> Thou was conceiv'd! He in the world
      was one<br /> For arrogance noted; to his memory<br /> No virtue lends its

      How many now hold themselves mighty kings<br /> Who here like swine shall
      wallow in the mire,<br /> Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!"<br />
      <br />I then: "Master! him fain would I behold<br /> Whelm'd in these dregs,

      the miry tribes<br /> Set on him with such violence, that yet<br /> For that
      render I thanks to God and praise<br /> "To Filippo Argenti:" cried they
      all:<br /> And on himself the moody Florentine<br /> Turn'd his avenging

      There certes in the valley I descry,<br /> Gleaming vermilion, as if they
      from fire<br /> Had issu'd." &nbsp;He replied: "Eternal fire,<br /> That
      inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame<br /> Illum'd; as in this nether
      hell thou seest."<br /> <br />We came within the fosses deep, that moat<br />
      This region comfortless. &nbsp;The walls appear'd<br /> As they were fram'd
      of iron. &nbsp;We had made<br /> Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd,
      where loud<br /> The mariner cried vehement: "Go forth!<br /> The' entrance
      is here!" &nbsp;Upon the gates I spied<br /> More than a thousand, who of
      old from heaven<br /> Were hurl'd. &nbsp;With ireful gestures, "Who is
      this,"<br /> They cried, "that without death first felt, goes through<br />
      The regions of the dead?" &nbsp;My sapient guide<br /> Made sign that he
      for secret parley wish'd;<br /> Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus<br />
      They spake: "Come thou alone; and let him go<br /> Who hath so hardily
      enter'd this realm.<br /> Alone return he by his witless way;<br /> If well
      he know it, let him prove. &nbsp;For thee,<br /> Here shalt thou tarry, who
      through clime so dark<br /> Hast been his escort." Now bethink thee,
      reader!<br /> What cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words.<br /> I
      did believe I never should return.<br /> <br />"O my lov'd guide! who more

      deep, whereto I stood expos'd,<br /> Desert me not," I cried, "in this

      saw my guide turn back,<br /> Chas'd that from his which newly they had
      worn,<br /> And inwardly restrain'd it. &nbsp;He, as one<br /> Who listens,
      stood attentive: for his eye<br /> Not far could lead him through the sable
      air,<br /> And the thick-gath'ring cloud. &nbsp;"It yet behooves<br /> We

      beginning; for the last he spake<br /> Agreed not with the first. &nbsp;But
      not the less<br /> My fear was at his saying; sith I drew<br /> To import
      worse perchance, than that he held,<br /> His mutilated speech. &nbsp;"Doth
      ever any<br /> Into this rueful concave's extreme depth<br /> Descend, out
      of the first degree, whose pain<br /> Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?"<br />
      <br />Thus I inquiring. "Rarely," he replied,<br /> "It chances, that among
      us any makes<br /> This journey, which I wend. &nbsp;Erewhile 'tis true<br />
      Once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell<br /> Erictho, sorceress, who
      compell'd the shades<br /> Back to their bodies. &nbsp;No long space my
      flesh<br /> Was naked of me, when within these walls<br /> She made me
      enter, to draw forth a spirit<br /> From out of Judas' circle. &nbsp;Lowest
      place<br /> Is that of all, obscurest, and remov'd<br /> Farthest from

      The city' of grief encompasses, which now<br /> We may not enter without
      rage." &nbsp;Yet more<br /> He added: but I hold it not in mind,<br /> For
      that mine eye toward the lofty tower<br /> Had drawn me wholly, to its
      burning top.<br /> Where in an instant I beheld uprisen<br /> At once three
      hellish furies stain'd with blood:<br /> In limb and motion feminine they
      seem'd;<br /> Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd<br /> Their
      volumes; adders and cerastes crept<br /> Instead of hair, and their fierce
      temples bound.<br /> <br />He knowing well the miserable hags<br /> Who tend
      the queen of endless woe, thus spake:<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      they each one clawing tore; themselves<br /> Smote with their palms, and
      such shrill clamour rais'd,<br /> That to the bard I clung,
      suspicion-bound.<br /> "Hasten Medusa: so to adamant<br /> Him shall we

      trusted he my hands, but with his own<br /> He also hid me. &nbsp;Ye of
      intellect<br /> Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd<br /> Under
      close texture of the mystic strain!<br /> <br />And now there came o'er the
      perturbed waves<br /> Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made<br />

      vapours sprung,<br /> That 'gainst some forest driving all its might,<br />
      Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls<br /> Afar; then onward
      passing proudly sweeps<br /> Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds
      fly.<br /> <br />Mine eyes he loos'd, and spake: "And now direct<br /> Thy
      visual nerve along that ancient foam,<br /> There, thickest where the smoke

      Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one<br /> Lies on a heap; more
      than a thousand spirits<br /> Destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one<br />
      Who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound.<br /> He, from his face
      removing the gross air,<br /> Oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd
      alone<br /> By that annoyance wearied. &nbsp;I perceiv'd<br /> That he was
      sent from heav'n, and to my guide<br /> Turn'd me, who signal made that I
      should stand<br /> Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full<br /> Of noble

      Such orisons ascend." &nbsp;Sighing he shook<br /> The head, then thus
      resum'd: "In that affray<br /> I stood not singly, nor without just cause<br />
      Assuredly should with the rest have stirr'd;<br /> But singly there I
      stood, when by consent<br /> Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd,<br />
      The one who openly forbad the deed."<br /> <br />"So may thy lineage find at
      last repose,"<br /> I thus adjur'd him, "as thou solve this knot,<br />
      Which now involves my mind. &nbsp;If right I hear,<br /> Ye seem to view
      beforehand, that which time<br /> Leads with him, of the present
      uninform'd."<br /> <br />"We view, as one who hath an evil sight,"<br /> He
      answer'd, "plainly, objects far remote:<br /> So much of his large spendour
      yet imparts<br /> The' Almighty Ruler; but when they approach<br /> Or
      actually exist, our intellect<br /> Then wholly fails, nor of your human
      state<br /> Except what others bring us know we aught.<br /> Hence therefore
      mayst thou understand, that all<br /> Our knowledge in that instant shall
      expire,<br /> When on futurity the portals close."<br /> <br />Then conscious
      of my fault, and by remorse<br /> Smitten, I added thus: "Now shalt thou
      say<br /> To him there fallen, that his offspring still<br /> Is to the
      living join'd; and bid him know,<br /> That if from answer silent I
      abstain'd,<br /> 'Twas that my thought was occupied intent<br /> Upon that
      error, which thy help hath solv'd."<br /> <br />But now my master summoning
      me back<br /> I heard, and with more eager haste besought<br /> The spirit
      to inform me, who with him<br /> Partook his lot. &nbsp;He answer thus
      return'd:<br /> <br />"More than a thousand with me here are laid<br />
      Within is Frederick, second of that name,<br /> And the Lord Cardinal, and
      of the rest<br /> I speak not." &nbsp;He, this said, from sight withdrew.<br />
      But I my steps towards the ancient bard<br /> Reverting, ruminated on the
      words<br /> Betokening me such ill. &nbsp;Onward he mov'd,<br /> And thus in
      going question'd: "Whence the' amaze<br /> That holds thy senses wrapt?"
      &nbsp;I satisfied<br /> The' inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight:<br />
      "Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard<br /> To thee importing
      harm; and note thou this,"<br /> With his rais'd finger bidding me take
      heed,<br /> <br />"When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,<br />
      Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life<br /> The future tenour will
      to thee unfold."<br /> <br />Forthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet:<br />
      We left the wall, and tow'rds the middle space<br /> Went by a path, that
      to a valley strikes;<br /> Which e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.

      "Philosophy, to an attentive ear,<br /> Clearly points out, not in one part

      dilapidated crags, that oft<br /> Mov'd underneath my feet, to weight like
      theirs<br /> Unus'd. &nbsp;I pond'ring went, and thus he spake:<br /> <br />"Perhaps
      thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep,<br /> Guarded by the brute violence,
      which I<br /> Have vanquish'd now. Know then, that when I erst<br /> Hither
      descended to the nether hell,<br /> This rock was not yet fallen. &nbsp;But
      past doubt<br /> (If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,<br /> Who carried
      off from Dis the mighty spoil<br /> Of the highest circle, then through all
      its bounds<br /> Such trembling seiz'd the deep concave and foul,<br /> I

      breast, where the two natures join,<br /> Thus made reply: "He is indeed
      alive,<br /> And solitary so must needs by me<br /> Be shown the gloomy
      vale, thereto induc'd<br /> By strict necessity, not by delight.<br /> She
      left her joyful harpings in the sky,<br /> Who this new office to my care

      turning, Chiron thus<br /> To Nessus spake: "Return, and be their guide.<br />
      And if ye chance to cross another troop,<br /> Command them keep aloof."
      &nbsp;Onward we mov'd,<br /> The faithful escort by our side, along<br />
      The border of the crimson-seething flood,<br /> Whence from those steep'd
      within loud shrieks arose.<br /> <br />Some there I mark'd, as high as to
      their brow<br /> Immers'd, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:<br /> "These are
      the souls of tyrants, who were given<br /> To blood and rapine. &nbsp;Here
      they wail aloud<br /> Their merciless wrongs. &nbsp;Here Alexander dwells,<br />
      And Dionysius fell, who many a year<br /> Of woe wrought for fair Sicily.

      turned me round, and thus he spake; "Let him<br /> Be to thee now first
      leader, me but next<br /> To him in rank." &nbsp;Then farther on a space<br />
      The Centaur paus'd, near some, who at the throat<br /> Were extant from the
      wave; and showing us<br /> A spirit by itself apart retir'd,<br />
      Exclaim'd: "He in God's bosom smote the heart,<br /> Which yet is honour'd

      And even all the bust above the stream.<br /> 'Midst these I many a face
      remember'd well.<br /> Thus shallow more and more the blood became,<br /> So
      that at last it but imbru'd the feet;<br /> And there our passage lay
      athwart the foss.<br /> <br />"As ever on this side the boiling wave<br />

      well assur'd,<br /> It lower still and lower sinks its bed,<br /> Till in
      that part it reuniting join,<br /> Where 't is the lot of tyranny to mourn.<br />

      shutting, with a skill so sweet,<br /> That besides me, into his inmost
      breast<br /> Scarce any other could admittance find.<br /> The faith I bore
      to my high charge was such,<br /> It cost me the life-blood that warm'd my
      veins.<br /> The harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes<br /> From
      Caesar's household, common vice and pest<br /> Of courts, 'gainst me
      inflam'd the minds of all;<br /> And to Augustus they so spread the flame,<br />
      That my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.<br /> My soul, disdainful and
      disgusted, sought<br /> Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,<br /> Just
      as I was, unjust toward myself.<br /> By the new roots, which fix this
      stem, I swear,<br /> That never faith I broke to my liege lord,<br /> Who
      merited such honour; and of you,<br /> If any to the world indeed return,<br />
      Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies<br /> Yet prostrate under envy's
      cruel blow."<br /> <br />First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words<br />
      Were ended, then to me the bard began:<br /> "Lose not the time; but speak
      and of him ask,<br /> If more thou wish to learn." &nbsp;Whence I replied:<br />
      "Question thou him again of whatsoe'er<br /> Will, as thou think'st,
      content me; for no power<br /> Have I to ask, such pity' is at my heart."<br />
      <br />He thus resum'd; "So may he do for thee<br /> Freely what thou
      entreatest, as thou yet<br /> Be pleas'd, imprison'd Spirit! to declare,<br />
      How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;<br /> And whether any ever
      from such frame<br /> Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell."<br />
      <br />Thereat the trunk breath'd hard, and the wind soon<br /> Chang'd into
      sounds articulate like these;<br /> <br />Briefly ye shall be answer'd.
      &nbsp;"When departs<br /> The fierce soul from the body, by itself<br />
      Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf<br /> By Minos doom'd, into the
      wood it falls,<br /> No place assign'd, but wheresoever chance<br /> Hurls
      it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,<br /> It rises to a sapling,
      growing thence<br /> A savage plant. &nbsp;The Harpies, on its leaves<br />
      Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain<br /> A vent to grief.
      &nbsp;We, as the rest, shall come<br /> For our own spoils, yet not so that
      with them<br /> We may again be clad; for what a man<br /> Takes from
      himself it is not just he have.<br /> Here we perforce shall drag them; and
      throughout<br /> The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,<br /> Each on
      the wild thorn of his wretched shade."<br /> <br />Attentive yet to listen
      to the trunk<br /> We stood, expecting farther speech, when us<br /> A noise
      surpris'd, as when a man perceives<br /> The wild boar and the hunt
      approach his place<br /> Of station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs<br />
      Loud rustling round him hears. &nbsp;And lo! there came<br /> Two naked,
      torn with briers, in headlong flight,<br /> That they before them broke
      each fan o' th' wood.<br /> "Haste now," the foremost cried, "now haste
      thee death!"<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="images/13-143.jpg">ENLARGE

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> The' other, as seem'd, impatient of delay<br />
      Exclaiming, "Lano! not so bent for speed<br /> Thy sinews, in the lists of
      Toppo's field."<br /> And then, for that perchance no longer breath<br />
      Suffic'd him, of himself and of a bush<br /> One group he made. &nbsp;Behind
      them was the wood<br /> Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,<br />
      As greyhounds that have newly slipp'd the leash.<br /> On him, who squatted
      down, they stuck their fangs,<br /> And having rent him piecemeal bore away<br />
      The tortur'd limbs. &nbsp;My guide then seiz'd my hand,<br /> And led me to
      the thicket, which in vain<br /> Mourn'd through its bleeding wounds: "O
      Giacomo<br /> Of Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee,"<br /> It cried, "that
      of me thou hast made thy screen?<br /> For thy ill life what blame on me
      recoils?"<br /> <br />When o'er it he had paus'd, my master spake:<br /> "Say
      who wast thou, that at so many points<br /> Breath'st out with blood thy
      lamentable speech?"<br /> <br />He answer'd: "Oh, ye spirits: arriv'd in
      time<br /> To spy the shameful havoc, that from me<br /> My leaves hath
      sever'd thus, gather them up,<br /> And at the foot of their sad
      parent-tree<br /> Carefully lay them. &nbsp;In that city' I dwelt,<br /> Who
      for the Baptist her first patron chang'd,<br /> Whence he for this shall
      cease not with his art<br /> To work her woe: and if there still remain'd
      not<br /> On Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him,<br /> Those citizens,
      who rear'd once more her walls<br /> Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br />
      Had labour'd without profit of their toil.<br /> I slung the fatal noose

      <br /> SOON as the charity of native land<br /> Wrought in my bosom, I the
      scatter'd leaves<br /> Collected, and to him restor'd, who now<br /> Was
      hoarse with utt'rance. &nbsp;To the limit thence<br /> We came, which from
      the third the second round<br /> Divides, and where of justice is display'd<br />
      Contrivance horrible. &nbsp;Things then first seen<br /> Clearlier to
      manifest, I tell how next<br /> A plain we reach'd, that from its sterile
      bed<br /> Each plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round<br /> Its
      garland on all sides, as round the wood<br /> Spreads the sad foss. &nbsp;There,
      on the very edge,<br /> Our steps we stay'd. &nbsp;It was an area wide<br />
      Of arid sand and thick, resembling most<br /> The soil that erst by Cato's
      foot was trod.<br /> <br />Vengeance of Heav'n! Oh! how shouldst thou be
      fear'd<br /> By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!<br /> <br />Of naked
      spirits many a flock I saw,<br /> All weeping piteously, to different laws<br />
      Subjected: for on the' earth some lay supine,<br /> Some crouching close
      were seated, others pac'd<br /> Incessantly around; the latter tribe,<br />
      More numerous, those fewer who beneath<br /> The torment lay, but louder in
      their grief.<br /> <br />O'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down<br />
      Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow<br /> On Alpine summit, when the
      wind is hush'd.<br /> As in the torrid Indian clime, the son<br /> Of Ammon
      saw upon his warrior band<br /> Descending, solid flames, that to the
      ground<br /> Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop<br /> To
      trample on the soil; for easier thus<br /> The vapour was extinguish'd,
      while alone;<br /> So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith<br /> The
      marble glow'd underneath, as under stove<br /> The viands, doubly to
      augment the pain.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="images/14-147.jpg">ENLARGE

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,<br /> Now
      this, now that way glancing, to shake off<br /> The heat, still falling
      fresh. &nbsp;I thus began:<br /> "Instructor! thou who all things
      overcom'st,<br /> Except the hardy demons, that rush'd forth<br /> To stop
      our entrance at the gate, say who<br /> Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems,
      heeds not<br /> The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,<br /> As by
      the sultry tempest immatur'd?"<br /> <br />Straight he himself, who was
      aware I ask'd<br /> My guide of him, exclaim'd: "Such as I was<br /> When
      living, dead such now I am. &nbsp;If Jove<br /> Weary his workman out, from
      whom in ire<br /> He snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day<br />
      Transfix'd me, if the rest be weary out<br /> At their black smithy
      labouring by turns<br /> In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;<br /> "Help,
      help, good Mulciber!" as erst he cried<br /> In the Phlegraean warfare, and
      the bolts<br /> Launch he full aim'd at me with all his might,<br /> He
      never should enjoy a sweet revenge."<br /> <br />Then thus my guide, in
      accent higher rais'd<br /> Than I before had heard him: "Capaneus!<br />
      Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride<br /> Lives yet unquench'd:
      no torrent, save thy rage,<br /> Were to thy fury pain proportion'd full."<br />
      <br />Next turning round to me with milder lip<br /> He spake: "This of the
      seven kings was one,<br /> Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,<br />
      As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,<br /> And sets his high
      omnipotence at nought.<br /> But, as I told him, his despiteful mood<br />
      Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.<br /> Follow me now; and
      look thou set not yet<br /> Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood<br />
      Keep ever close." &nbsp;Silently on we pass'd<br /> To where there gushes
      from the forest's bound<br /> A little brook, whose crimson'd wave yet
      lifts<br /> My hair with horror. &nbsp;As the rill, that runs<br /> From
      Bulicame, to be portion'd out<br /> Among the sinful women; so ran this<br />
      Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank<br /> Stone-built, and
      either margin at its side,<br /> Whereon I straight perceiv'd our passage
      lay.<br /> <br />"Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate<br /> We
      enter'd first, whose threshold is to none<br /> Denied, nought else so
      worthy of regard,<br /> As is this river, has thine eye discern'd,<br />
      O'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd."<br /> <br />So spake my
      guide; and I him thence besought,<br /> That having giv'n me appetite to
      know,<br /> The food he too would give, that hunger crav'd.<br /> <br />"In
      midst of ocean," forthwith he began,<br /> "A desolate country lies, which
      Crete is nam'd,<br /> Under whose monarch in old times the world<br /> Liv'd
      pure and chaste. &nbsp;A mountain rises there,<br /> Call'd Ida, joyous
      once with leaves and streams,<br /> Deserted now like a forbidden thing.<br />
      It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse,<br /> Chose for the secret
      cradle of her son;<br /> And better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts<br />
      His infant cries. &nbsp;Within the mount, upright<br /> An ancient form
      there stands and huge, that turns<br /> His shoulders towards Damiata, and
      at Rome<br /> As in his mirror looks. &nbsp;Of finest gold<br /> His head is
      shap'd, pure silver are the breast<br /> And arms; thence to the middle is
      of brass.<br /> And downward all beneath well-temper'd steel,<br /> Save the
      right foot of potter's clay, on which<br /> Than on the other more erect he
      stands,<br /> Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;<br /> And from
      the fissure tears distil, which join'd<br /> Penetrate to that cave. &nbsp;They
      in their course<br /> Thus far precipitated down the rock<br /> Form
      Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;<br /> Then by this straiten'd channel
      passing hence<br /> Beneath, e'en to the lowest depth of all,<br /> Form
      there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself<br /> Shall see it) I here give thee
      no account."<br /> <br />Then I to him: "If from our world this sluice<br />
      Be thus deriv'd; wherefore to us but now<br /> Appears it at this edge?"
      &nbsp;He straight replied:<br /> "The place, thou know'st, is round; and
      though great part<br /> Thou have already pass'd, still to the left<br />
      Descending to the nethermost, not yet<br /> Hast thou the circuit made of
      the whole orb.<br /> Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,<br /> It needs
      not bring up wonder in thy looks."<br /> <br />Then I again inquir'd: "Where
      flow the streams<br /> Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one<br /> Thou
      tell'st not, and the other of that shower,<br /> Thou say'st, is form'd."
      &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br /> "Doubtless thy questions all well
      pleas'd I hear.<br /> Yet the red seething wave might have resolv'd<br />
      One thou proposest. &nbsp;Lethe thou shalt see,<br /> But not within this
      hollow, in the place,<br /> Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,<br />
      Whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd."<br /> He added: "Time is now
      we quit the wood.<br /> Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give<br />
      Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;<br /> For over them all vapour is
      extinct." <br /><br /> <a name="link15"></a> <br /><br />

      <br /> One of the solid margins bears us now<br /> Envelop'd in the mist,
      that from the stream<br /> Arising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire<br />
      Both piers and water. &nbsp;As the Flemings rear<br /> Their mound, 'twixt
      Ghent and Bruges, to chase back<br /> The ocean, fearing his tumultuous
      tide<br /> That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs<br /> Along the

      though not in height or bulk to these<br /> Made equal, by the master,

      be willing,<br /> That I here seat me with thee, I consent;<br /> His leave,
      with whom I journey, first obtain'd."<br /> <br />"O son!" said he, "whoever

      therefore on. &nbsp;I close<br /> Will at thy garments walk, and then
      rejoin<br /> My troop, who go mourning their endless doom."<br /> <br />I
      dar'd not from the path descend to tread<br /> On equal ground with him,
      but held my head<br /> Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.<br />
      <br />"What chance or destiny," thus he began,<br /> "Ere the last day
      conducts thee here below?<br /> And who is this, that shows to thee the
      way?"<br /> <br />"There up aloft," I answer'd, "in the life<br /> Serene, I
      wander'd in a valley lost,<br /> Before mine age had to its fullness
      reach'd.<br /> But yester-morn I left it: then once more<br /> Into that
      vale returning, him I met;<br /> And by this path homeward he leads me

      canst not miss at last a glorious haven:<br /> Unless in fairer days my
      judgment err'd.<br /> And if my fate so early had not chanc'd,<br /> Seeing

      them is Priscian, and Accorso's son<br /> Francesco herds among that

      whom I may not sort,<br /> Approaches. &nbsp;I commend my TREASURE to thee,<br />

      And reft of all, was of more high estate<br /> Than thou believest;
      grandchild of the chaste<br /> Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call'd,<br />
      Who in his lifetime many a noble act<br /> Achiev'd, both by his wisdom and
      his sword.<br /> The other, next to me that beats the sand,<br /> Is
      Aldobrandi, name deserving well,<br /> In the' upper world, of honour; and
      myself<br /> Who in this torment do partake with them,<br /> Am Rusticucci,
      whom, past doubt, my wife<br /> Of savage temper, more than aught beside<br />
      Hath to this evil brought." &nbsp;If from the fire<br /> I had been
      shelter'd, down amidst them straight<br /> I then had cast me, nor my
      guide, I deem,<br /> Would have restrain'd my going; but that fear<br /> Of
      the dire burning vanquish'd the desire,<br /> Which made me eager of their
      wish'd embrace.<br /> <br />I then began: "Not scorn, but grief much more,<br />
      Such as long time alone can cure, your doom<br /> Fix'd deep within me,
      soon as this my lord<br /> Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect<br />
      That such a race, as ye are, was at hand.<br /> I am a countryman of yours,
      who still<br /> Affectionate have utter'd, and have heard<br /> Your deeds
      and names renown'd. &nbsp;Leaving the gall<br /> For the sweet fruit I go,
      that a sure guide<br /> Hath promis'd to me. &nbsp;But behooves, that far<br />
      As to the centre first I downward tend."<br /> <br />"So may long space thy
      spirit guide thy limbs,"<br /> He answer straight return'd; "and so thy
      fame<br /> Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,<br /> If
      courtesy and valour, as they wont,<br /> Dwell in our city, or have
      vanish'd clean?<br /> For one amidst us late condemn'd to wail,<br />
      Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,<br /> Grieves us no little by the
      news he brings."<br /> <br />"An upstart multitude and sudden gains,<br />
      Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee<br /> Engender'd, so that now in
      tears thou mourn'st!"<br /> Thus cried I with my face uprais'd, and they<br />
      All three, who for an answer took my words,<br /> Look'd at each other, as
      men look when truth<br /> Comes to their ear. &nbsp;"If thou at other
      times,"<br /> They all at once rejoin'd, "so easily<br /> Satisfy those, who
      question, happy thou,<br /> Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!<br />
      Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,<br /> Returning to behold the
      radiant stars,<br /> When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,<br />
      See that of us thou speak among mankind."<br /> <br />This said, they broke
      the circle, and so swift<br /> Fled, that as pinions seem'd their nimble
      feet.<br /> <br />Not in so short a time might one have said<br /> "Amen," as
      they had vanish'd. Straight my guide<br /> Pursu'd his track. &nbsp;I
      follow'd; and small space<br /> Had we pass'd onward, when the water's
      sound<br /> Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce<br /> Heard one
      another's speech for the loud din.<br /> <br />E'en as the river, that holds
      on its course<br /> Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,<br /> On the left
      side of Apennine, toward<br /> The east, which Acquacheta higher up<br />
      They call, ere it descend into the vale,<br /> At Forli by that name no
      longer known,<br /> Rebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on<br /> From the'
      Alpine summit down a precipice,<br /> Where space enough to lodge a
      thousand spreads;<br /> Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,<br />
      That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,<br /> So that the ear its
      clamour soon had stunn'd.<br /> <br />I had a cord that brac'd my girdle
      round,<br /> Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take<br /> The
      painted leopard. &nbsp;This when I had all<br /> Unloosen'd from me (so my
      master bade)<br /> I gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him.<br /> Then
      to the right he turn'd, and from the brink<br /> Standing few paces
      distant, cast it down<br /> Into the deep abyss. &nbsp;"And somewhat
      strange,"<br /> Thus to myself I spake, "signal so strange<br /> Betokens,
      which my guide with earnest eye<br /> Thus follows." &nbsp;Ah! what caution
      must men use<br /> With those who look not at the deed alone,<br /> But spy
      into the thoughts with subtle skill!<br /> <br />"Quickly shall come," he
      said, "what I expect,<br /> Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof<br />
      Thy thought is dreaming." &nbsp;Ever to that truth,<br /> Which but the
      semblance of a falsehood wears,<br /> A man, if possible, should bar his
      lip;<br /> Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach.<br /> But silence
      here were vain; and by these notes<br /> Which now I sing, reader! I swear
      to thee,<br /> So may they favour find to latest times!<br /> That through
      the gross and murky air I spied<br /> A shape come swimming up, that might
      have quell'd<br /> The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise<br /> As
      one returns, who hath been down to loose<br /> An anchor grappled fast

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,<br />
      His head and upper part expos'd on land,<br /> But laid not on the shore
      his bestial train.<br /> His face the semblance of a just man's wore,<br />
      So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;<br /> The rest was serpent all:
      two shaggy claws<br /> Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,<br />
      And either side, were painted o'er with nodes<br /> And orbits. &nbsp;Colours
      variegated more<br /> Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state<br />
      With interchangeable embroidery wove,<br /> Nor spread Arachne o'er her
      curious loom.<br /> As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,<br />
      Stands part in water, part upon the land;<br /> Or, as where dwells the
      greedy German boor,<br /> The beaver settles watching for his prey;<br /> So
      on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,<br /> Sat perch'd the fiend of
      evil. &nbsp;In the void<br /> Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous
      fork,<br /> With sting like scorpion's arm'd. &nbsp;Then thus my guide:<br />
      "Now need our way must turn few steps apart,<br /> Far as to that ill
      beast, who couches there."<br /> <br />Thereat toward the right our downward
      course<br /> We shap'd, and, better to escape the flame<br /> And burning
      marle, ten paces on the verge<br /> Proceeded. &nbsp;Soon as we to him
      arrive,<br /> A little further on mine eye beholds<br /> A tribe of spirits,
      seated on the sand<br /> Near the wide chasm. &nbsp;Forthwith my master
      spake:<br /> "That to the full thy knowledge may extend<br /> Of all this
      round contains, go now, and mark<br /> The mien these wear: but hold not
      long discourse.<br /> Till thou returnest, I with him meantime<br /> Will
      parley, that to us he may vouchsafe<br /> The aid of his strong shoulders."
      &nbsp;Thus alone<br /> Yet forward on the' extremity I pac'd<br /> Of that
      seventh circle, where the mournful tribe<br /> Were seated. &nbsp;At the
      eyes forth gush'd their pangs.<br /> Against the vapours and the torrid
      soil<br /> Alternately their shifting hands they plied.<br /> Thus use the
      dogs in summer still to ply<br /> Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten
      sore<br /> By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.<br /> <br />Noting
      the visages of some, who lay<br /> Beneath the pelting of that dolorous
      fire,<br /> One of them all I knew not; but perceiv'd,<br /> That pendent
      from his neck each bore a pouch<br /> With colours and with emblems various
      mark'd,<br /> On which it seem'd as if their eye did feed.<br /> <br />And
      when amongst them looking round I came,<br /> A yellow purse I saw with
      azure wrought,<br /> That wore a lion's countenance and port.<br /> Then
      still my sight pursuing its career,<br /> Another I beheld, than blood more
      red.<br /> A goose display of whiter wing than curd.<br /> And one, who bore
      a fat and azure swine<br /> Pictur'd on his white scrip, addressed me thus:<br />
      "What dost thou in this deep? &nbsp;Go now and know,<br /> Since yet thou
      livest, that my neighbour here<br /> Vitaliano on my left shall sit.<br /> A
      Paduan with these Florentines am I.<br /> Ofttimes they thunder in mine
      ears, exclaiming<br /> 'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch<br />
      With the three beaks will bring!'" &nbsp;This said, he writh'd<br /> The
      mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox<br /> That licks his nostrils.
      &nbsp;I, lest longer stay<br /> He ill might brook, who bade me stay not
      long,<br /> Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd.<br /> <br />My
      guide already seated on the haunch<br /> Of the fierce animal I found; and
      thus<br /> He me encourag'd. &nbsp;"Be thou stout; be bold.<br /> Down such
      a steep flight must we now descend!<br /> Mount thou before: for that no
      power the tail<br /> May have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst."<br />
      <br />As one, who hath an ague fit so near,<br /> His nails already are
      turn'd blue, and he<br /> Quivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade;<br />
      Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.<br /> But shame soon interpos'd
      her threat, who makes<br /> The servant bold in presence of his lord.<br />
      <br />I settled me upon those shoulders huge,<br /> And would have said, but
      that the words to aid<br /> My purpose came not, "Look thou clasp me firm!"<br />
      <br />But he whose succour then not first I prov'd,<br /> Soon as I mounted,
      in his arms aloft,<br /> Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:<br />
      "Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres<br /> Of ample circuit, easy
      thy descent.<br /> Think on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st."<br /> <br />As
      a small vessel, back'ning out from land,<br /> Her station quits; so thence
      the monster loos'd,<br /> And when he felt himself at large, turn'd round<br />
      There where the breast had been, his forked tail.<br /> Thus, like an eel,
      outstretch'd at length he steer'd,<br /> Gath'ring the air up with
      retractile claws.<br /> <br />Not greater was the dread when Phaeton<br />
      The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,<br /> Whereof signs yet
      appear, was wrapt in flames;<br /> Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv'd,<br />
      By liquefaction of the scalded wax,<br /> The trusted pennons loosen'd from
      his loins,<br /> His sire exclaiming loud, "Ill way thou keep'st!"<br />
      Than was my dread, when round me on each part<br /> The air I view'd, and
      other object none<br /> Save the fell beast. &nbsp;He slowly sailing,
      wheels<br /> His downward motion, unobserv'd of me,<br /> But that the wind,
      arising to my face,<br /> Breathes on me from below. &nbsp;Now on our right<br />
      I heard the cataract beneath us leap<br /> With hideous crash; whence

      <br /> THERE is a place within the depths of hell<br /> Call'd Malebolge,
      all of rock dark-stain'd<br /> With hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep<br />
      That round it circling winds. &nbsp;Right in the midst<br /> Of that
      abominable region, yawns<br /> A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame<br />
      Due time shall tell. &nbsp;The circle, that remains,<br /> Throughout its
      round, between the gulf and base<br /> Of the high craggy banks, successive
      forms<br /> Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk.<br /> <br />As where to
      guard the walls, full many a foss<br /> Begirds some stately castle, sure
      defence<br /> Affording to the space within, so here<br /> Were model'd
      these; and as like fortresses<br /> E'en from their threshold to the brink
      without,<br /> Are flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base<br /> Thus
      flinty paths advanc'd, that 'cross the moles<br /> And dikes, struck onward
      far as to the gulf,<br /> That in one bound collected cuts them off.<br />
      Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves<br /> From Geryon's back

      depart<br /> From those eternal barriers. When arriv'd,<br /> Where
      underneath the gaping arch lets pass<br /> The scourged souls: "Pause
      here," the teacher said,<br /> "And let these others miserable, now<br />
      Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,<br /> For that together they with
      us have walk'd."<br /> <br />From the old bridge we ey'd the pack, who came<br />
      From th' other side towards us, like the rest,<br /> Excoriate from the
      lash. &nbsp;My gentle guide,<br /> By me unquestion'd, thus his speech
      resum'd:<br /> "Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,<br /> And seems
      too woe-begone to drop a tear.<br /> How yet the regal aspect he retains!<br />
      Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won<br /> The ram from Colchos. To the
      Lemnian isle<br /> His passage thither led him, when those bold<br /> And
      pitiless women had slain all their males.<br /> There he with tokens and
      fair witching words<br /> Hypsipyle beguil'd, a virgin young,<br /> Who
      first had all the rest herself beguil'd.<br /> Impregnated he left her
      there forlorn.<br /> Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.<br /> Here
      too Medea's inj'ries are avenged.<br /> All bear him company, who like
      deceit<br /> To his have practis'd. &nbsp;And thus much to know<br /> Of the
      first vale suffice thee, and of those<br /> Whom its keen torments urge."
      &nbsp;Now had we come<br /> Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten'd
      path<br /> Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.<br /> <br />Hence in the
      second chasm we heard the ghosts,<br /> Who jibber in low melancholy
      sounds,<br /> With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves<br />
      Smite with their palms. &nbsp;Upon the banks a scurf<br /> From the foul
      steam condens'd, encrusting hung,<br /> That held sharp combat with the
      sight and smell.<br /> <br />So hollow is the depth, that from no part,<br />
      Save on the summit of the rocky span,<br /> Could I distinguish aught.
      &nbsp;Thus far we came;<br /> And thence I saw, within the foss below,<br />

      strait and perforated close.<br /> Nor from his side my leader set me down,<br />
      Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb<br /> Quiv'ring express'd his
      pang. &nbsp;"Whoe'er thou art,<br /> Sad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a

      their length they lie<br /> Along an opening in the rock. &nbsp;'Midst them<br />
      I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,<br /> For whom I took thee, when
      so hastily<br /> I question'd. &nbsp;But already longer time<br /> Hath
      pass'd, since my souls kindled, and I thus<br /> Upturn'd have stood, than
      is his doom to stand<br /> Planted with fiery feet. &nbsp;For after him,<br />
      One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,<br /> From forth the west, a
      shepherd without law,<br /> Fated to cover both his form and mine.<br /> He
      a new Jason shall be call'd, of whom<br /> In Maccabees we read; and favour
      such<br /> As to that priest his king indulgent show'd,<br /> Shall be of
      France's monarch shown to him."<br /> <br />I know not if I here too far
      presum'd,<br /> But in this strain I answer'd: "Tell me now,<br /> What
      treasures from St. Peter at the first<br /> Our Lord demanded, when he put
      the keys<br /> Into his charge? &nbsp;Surely he ask'd no more<br /> But,
      Follow me! Nor Peter nor the rest<br /> Or gold or silver of Matthias took,<br />
      When lots were cast upon the forfeit place<br /> Of the condemned soul.

      look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,<br /> Which against Charles thy
      hardihood inspir'd.<br /> If reverence of the keys restrain'd me not,<br />
      Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet<br /> Severer speech might
      use. &nbsp;Your avarice<br /> O'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot<br />
      Treading the good, and raising bad men up.<br /> Of shepherds, like to you,
      th' Evangelist<br /> Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,<br /> With
      kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,<br /> She who with seven heads tower'd
      at her birth,<br /> And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,<br /> Long
      as her spouse in virtue took delight.<br /> Of gold and silver ye have made
      your god,<br /> Diff'ring wherein from the idolater,<br /> But he that
      worships one, a hundred ye?<br /> Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave

      pleas'd, with so compos'd<br /> A lip, he listen'd ever to the sound<br />
      Of the true words I utter'd. &nbsp;In both arms<br /> He caught, and to his
      bosom lifting me<br /> Upward retrac'd the way of his descent.<br /> <br />Nor
      weary of his weight he press'd me close,<br /> Till to the summit of the
      rock we came,<br /> Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.<br /> His
      cherish'd burden there gently he plac'd<br /> Upon the rugged rock and
      steep, a path<br /> Not easy for the clamb'ring goat to mount.<br /> <br />Thence

      this the twentieth strain<br /> Of the first song, whose awful theme
      records<br /> The spirits whelm'd in woe. &nbsp;Earnest I look'd<br /> Into

      down-streaming roll'd. &nbsp;Against a rock<br /> I leant and wept, so that
      my guide exclaim'd:<br /> "What, and art thou too witless as the rest?<br />

      a wide flat<br /> It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh<br /> It covers,

      land; but ne'er<br /> To such a strange recorder I beheld,<br /> In
      evolution moving, horse nor foot,<br /> Nor ship, that tack'd by sign from
      land or star.<br /> <br />With the ten demons on our way we went;<br /> Ah
      fearful company! but in the church<br /> With saints, with gluttons at the
      tavern's mess.<br /> <br />Still earnest on the pitch I gaz'd, to mark<br />
      All things whate'er the chasm contain'd, and those<br /> Who burn'd within.
      &nbsp;As dolphins, that, in sign<br /> To mariners, heave high their arched
      backs,<br /> That thence forewarn'd they may advise to save<br /> Their
      threaten'd vessels; so, at intervals,<br /> To ease the pain his back some
      sinner show'd,<br /> Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.<br />
      <br />E'en as the frogs, that of a wat'ry moat<br /> Stand at the brink,
      with the jaws only out,<br /> Their feet and of the trunk all else
      concealed,<br /> Thus on each part the sinners stood, but soon<br /> As
      Barbariccia was at hand, so they<br /> Drew back under the wave. &nbsp;I
      saw, and yet<br /> My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,<br /> As it
      befalls that oft one frog remains,<br /> While the next springs away: and
      Graffiacan,<br /> Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz'd<br /> His
      clotted locks, and dragg'd him sprawling up,<br /> That he appear'd to me
      an otter. &nbsp;Each<br /> Already by their names I knew, so well<br /> When
      they were chosen, I observ'd, and mark'd<br /> How one the other call'd. "O
      Rubicant!<br /> See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,"<br /> Shouted
      together all the cursed crew.<br /> <br />Then I: "Inform thee, master! if
      thou may,<br /> What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand<br /> His
      foes have laid." &nbsp;My leader to his side<br /> Approach'd, and whence
      he came inquir'd, to whom<br /> Was answer'd thus: "Born in Navarre's
      domain<br /> My mother plac'd me in a lord's retinue,<br /> For she had
      borne me to a losel vile,<br /> A spendthrift of his substance and himself.<br />
      The good king Thibault after that I serv'd,<br /> To peculating here my
      thoughts were turn'd,<br /> Whereof I give account in this dire heat."<br />
      <br />Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk<br /> Issued on either
      side, as from a boar,<br /> Ript him with one of these. &nbsp;'Twixt evil
      claws<br /> The mouse had fall'n: but Barbariccia cried,<br /> Seizing him
      with both arms: "Stand thou apart,<br /> While I do fix him on my prong
      transpierc'd."<br /> Then added, turning to my guide his face,<br />
      "Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,<br /> Ere he again be rent."
      &nbsp;My leader thus:<br /> "Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;<br />
      Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land<br /> Under the tar?"&mdash;"I
      parted," he replied,<br /> "But now from one, who sojourn'd not far thence;<br />
      So were I under shelter now with him!<br /> Nor hook nor talon then should
      scare me more."&mdash;.<br /> <br />"Too long we suffer," Libicocco cried,<br />
      Then, darting forth a prong, seiz'd on his arm,<br /> And mangled bore away
      the sinewy part.<br /> Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath<br /> Would
      next have caught, whence angrily their chief,<br /> Turning on all sides
      round, with threat'ning brow<br /> Restrain'd them. &nbsp;When their strife
      a little ceas'd,<br /> Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,<br /> My
      teacher thus without delay inquir'd:<br /> "Who was the spirit, from whom
      by evil hap<br /> Parting, as thou has told, thou cam'st to shore?"&mdash;<br />
      <br />"It was the friar Gomita," he rejoin'd,<br /> "He of Gallura, vessel
      of all guile,<br /> Who had his master's enemies in hand,<br /> And us'd
      them so that they commend him well.<br /> Money he took, and them at large
      dismiss'd.<br /> So he reports: and in each other charge<br /> Committed to
      his keeping, play'd the part<br /> Of barterer to the height: &nbsp;with
      him doth herd<br /> The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.<br /> Sardinia is
      a theme, whereof their tongue<br /> Is never weary. &nbsp;Out! alas! behold<br />
      That other, how he grins! More would I say,<br /> But tremble lest he mean
      to maul me sore."<br /> <br />Their captain then to Farfarello turning,<br />
      Who roll'd his moony eyes in act to strike,<br /> Rebuk'd him thus: "Off!
      cursed bird! Avaunt!"&mdash;<br /> <br />"If ye desire to see or hear," he
      thus<br /> Quaking with dread resum'd, "or Tuscan spirits<br /> Or Lombard,
      I will cause them to appear.<br /> Meantime let these ill talons bate their
      fury,<br /> So that no vengeance they may fear from them,<br /> And I,
      remaining in this self-same place,<br /> Will for myself but one, make
      sev'n appear,<br /> When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so<br /> Our
      custom is to call each other up."<br /> <br />Cagnazzo at that word deriding
      grinn'd,<br /> Then wagg'd the head and spake: "Hear his device,<br />
      Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down."<br /> <br />Whereto he thus, who
      fail'd not in rich store<br /> Of nice-wove toils; "Mischief forsooth
      extreme,<br /> Meant only to procure myself more woe!"<br /> <br />No longer
      Alichino then refrain'd,<br /> But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:<br />
      "If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot<br /> Will chase thee, but above
      the pitch will beat<br /> My plumes. &nbsp;Quit we the vantage ground, and
      let<br /> The bank be as a shield, that we may see<br /> If singly thou
      prevail against us all."<br /> <br />Now, reader, of new sport expect to
      hear!<br /> <br />They each one turn'd his eyes to the' other shore,<br /> He
      first, who was the hardest to persuade.<br /> The spirit of Navarre chose
      well his time,<br /> Planted his feet on land, and at one leap<br />
      Escaping disappointed their resolve.<br /> <br />Them quick resentment
      stung, but him the most,<br /> Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit<br />
      He therefore sped, exclaiming: "Thou art caught."<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />

      CANTO XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> IN silence and in solitude we went,<br /> One first, the other
      following his steps,<br /> As minor friars journeying on their road.<br />
      <br />The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse<br /> Upon old Aesop's
      fable, where he told<br /> What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.<br />
      For language hath not sounds more like in sense,<br /> Than are these
      chances, if the origin<br /> And end of each be heedfully compar'd.<br />
      And as one thought bursts from another forth,<br /> So afterward from that
      another sprang,<br /> Which added doubly to my former fear.<br /> For thus I
      reason'd: "These through us have been<br /> So foil'd, with loss and
      mock'ry so complete,<br /> As needs must sting them sore. &nbsp;If anger
      then<br /> Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell<br /> They shall
      pursue us, than the savage hound<br /> Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt
      his jaws."<br /> <br />Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all<br /> On end
      with terror, and look'd eager back.<br /> <br />"Teacher," I thus began, "if
      speedily<br /> Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread<br /> Those evil
      talons. &nbsp;Even now behind<br /> They urge us: quick imagination works<br />
      So forcibly, that I already feel them."<br /> <br />He answer'd: "Were I
      form'd of leaded glass,<br /> I should not sooner draw unto myself<br /> Thy
      outward image, than I now imprint<br /> That from within. &nbsp;This moment
      came thy thoughts<br /> Presented before mine, with similar act<br /> And
      count'nance similar, so that from both<br /> I one design have fram'd.
      &nbsp;If the right coast<br /> Incline so much, that we may thence descend<br />
      Into the other chasm, we shall escape<br /> Secure from this imagined
      pursuit."<br /> <br />He had not spoke his purpose to the end,<br /> When I
      from far beheld them with spread wings<br /> Approach to take us. &nbsp;Suddenly
      my guide<br /> Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep<br /> Is by the
      noise arous'd, and near her sees<br /> The climbing fires, who snatches up
      her babe<br /> And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him<br /> Than of
      herself, that but a single vest<br /> Clings round her limbs. &nbsp;Down
      from the jutting beach<br /> Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,<br />
      Which closes on one part the other chasm.<br /> <br />Never ran water with
      such hurrying pace<br /> Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,<br />
      When nearest it approaches to the spokes,<br /> As then along that edge my
      master ran,<br /> Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,<br /> Not a
      companion. &nbsp;Scarcely had his feet<br /> Reach'd to the lowest of the
      bed beneath,<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="images/23-219.jpg">ENLARGE

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear<br /> In
      him was none; for that high Providence,<br /> Which plac'd them ministers
      of the fifth foss,<br /> Power of departing thence took from them all.<br />
      <br />There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,<br /> Who pac'd with tardy
      steps around, and wept,<br /> Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.<br />
      Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down<br /> Before their eyes,
      in fashion like to those<br /> Worn by the monks in Cologne. &nbsp;Their
      outside<br /> Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,<br /> But leaden all
      within, and of such weight,<br /> That Frederick's compar'd to these were
      straw.<br /> Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!<br /> <br />We yet once more
      with them together turn'd<br /> To leftward, on their dismal moan intent.<br />
      But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came<br /> The fainting people, that
      our company<br /> Was chang'd at every movement of the step.<br /> <br />Whence
      I my guide address'd: "See that thou find<br /> Some spirit, whose name may
      by his deeds be known,<br /> And to that end look round thee as thou
      go'st."<br /> <br />Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,<br /> Cried
      after us aloud: "Hold in your feet,<br /> Ye who so swiftly speed through
      the dusk air.<br /> Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."<br />
      <br />Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:<br /> "Pause, and then onward
      at their pace proceed."<br /> <br />I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose
      look<br /> Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd<br /> To overtake me; but
      the load they bare<br /> And narrow path retarded their approach.<br />
      <br />Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance<br /> Perus'd me, but spake
      not: then turning each<br /> To other thus conferring said: "This one<br />
      Seems, by the action of his throat, alive.<br /> And, be they dead, what
      privilege allows<br /> They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"<br />

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Then thus to me: "Tuscan, who visitest<br /> The
      college of the mourning hypocrites,<br /> Disdain not to instruct us who
      thou art."<br /> <br />"By Arno's pleasant stream," I thus replied,<br /> "In
      the great city I was bred and grew,<br /> And wear the body I have ever
      worn.<br /> but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,<br /> As now I
      witness, courseth down your cheeks?<br /> What torment breaks forth in this
      bitter woe?"<br /> "Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,"<br /> One
      of them answer'd, "are so leaden gross,<br /> That with their weight they
      make the balances<br /> To crack beneath them. &nbsp;Joyous friars we were,<br />
      Bologna's natives, Catalano I,<br /> He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land<br />

      vicinage can best declare."<br /> <br />"O friars!" &nbsp;I began, "your
      miseries&mdash;"<br /> But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,<br />
      Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:<br /> He, when he saw me,
      writh'd himself, throughout<br /> Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his

      fitting for one man<br /> To suffer for the people. &nbsp;He doth lie<br />
      Transverse; nor any passes, but him first<br /> Behoves make feeling trial
      how each weighs.<br /> In straits like this along the foss are plac'd<br />
      The father of his consort, and the rest<br /> Partakers in that council,
      seed of ill<br /> And sorrow to the Jews." &nbsp;I noted then,<br /> How
      Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,<br /> Thus abjectly extended on the
      cross<br /> In banishment eternal. &nbsp;To the friar<br /> He next his
      words address'd: "We pray ye tell,<br /> If so be lawful, whether on our
      right<br /> Lies any opening in the rock, whereby<br /> We both may issue
      hence, without constraint<br /> On the dark angels, that compell'd they
      come<br /> To lead us from this depth." &nbsp;He thus replied:<br /> "Nearer
      than thou dost hope, there is a rock<br /> From the next circle moving,
      which o'ersteps<br /> Each vale of horror, save that here his cope<br /> Is
      shatter'd. &nbsp;By the ruin ye may mount:<br /> For on the side it slants,
      and most the height<br /> Rises below." &nbsp;With head bent down awhile<br />
      My leader stood, then spake: "He warn'd us ill,<br /> Who yonder hangs the
      sinners on his hook."<br /> <br />To whom the friar: "At Bologna erst<br /> I
      many vices of the devil heard,<br /> Among the rest was said, 'He is a
      liar,<br /> And the father of lies!'" &nbsp;When he had spoke,<br /> My
      leader with large strides proceeded on,<br /> Somewhat disturb'd with anger
      in his look.<br /> <br />I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,<br /> And
      following, his beloved footsteps mark'd. <br /><br /> <a name="link24"></a>

      <br /> IN the year's early nonage, when the sun<br /> Tempers his tresses in
      Aquarius' urn,<br /> And now towards equal day the nights recede,<br /> When
      as the rime upon the earth puts on<br /> Her dazzling sister's image, but
      not long<br /> Her milder sway endures, then riseth up<br /> The village
      hind, whom fails his wintry store,<br /> And looking out beholds the plain
      around<br /> All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites<br /> His thighs,
      and to his hut returning in,<br /> There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,<br />
      As a discomfited and helpless man;<br /> Then comes he forth again, and
      feels new hope<br /> Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon<br /> The
      world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,<br /> And forth to
      pasture drives his little flock:<br /> So me my guide dishearten'd when I
      saw<br /> His troubled forehead, and so speedily<br /> That ill was cur'd;
      for at the fallen bridge<br /> Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,<br />
      He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld<br /> At the steep mountain's
      foot. &nbsp;Regarding well<br /> The ruin, and some counsel first
      maintain'd<br /> With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm<br /> And took
      me up. &nbsp;As one, who, while he works,<br /> Computes his labour's
      issue, that he seems<br /> Still to foresee the' effect, so lifting me<br />
      Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd<br /> His eye upon another. &nbsp;"Grapple
      that,"<br /> Said he, "but first make proof, if it be such<br /> As will
      sustain thee." &nbsp;For one capp'd with lead<br /> This were no journey.
      &nbsp;Scarcely he, though light,<br /> And I, though onward push'd from
      crag to crag,<br /> Could mount. &nbsp;And if the precinct of this coast<br />
      Were not less ample than the last, for him<br /> I know not, but my
      strength had surely fail'd.<br /> But Malebolge all toward the mouth<br />
      Inclining of the nethermost abyss,<br /> The site of every valley hence
      requires,<br /> That one side upward slope, the other fall.<br /> <br />At
      length the point of our descent we reach'd<br /> From the last flag: soon
      as to that arriv'd,<br /> So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,<br /> I
      could no further, but did seat me there.<br /> <br />"Now needs thy best of
      man;" so spake my guide:<br /> "For not on downy plumes, nor under shade<br />
      Of canopy reposing, fame is won,<br /> Without which whosoe'er consumes his
      days<br /> Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,<br /> As smoke in air
      or foam upon the wave.<br /> Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness<br />
      By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd<br /> To vanquish, if she
      suffer not the weight<br /> Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.<br />
      A longer ladder yet remains to scale.<br /> From these to have escap'd
      sufficeth not.<br /> If well thou note me, profit by my words."<br /> <br />I
      straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent<br /> Than I in truth did
      feel me. &nbsp;"On," I cried,<br /> "For I am stout and fearless." &nbsp;Up
      the rock<br /> Our way we held, more rugged than before,<br /> Narrower and
      steeper far to climb. &nbsp;From talk<br /> I ceas'd not, as we journey'd,
      so to seem<br /> Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss<br /> Did
      issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill.<br /> Though on the arch that
      crosses there I stood,<br /> What were the words I knew not, but who spake<br />
      Seem'd mov'd in anger. &nbsp;Down I stoop'd to look,<br /> But my quick eye
      might reach not to the depth<br /> For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I
      spake:<br /> "To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,<br /> And from
      the wall dismount we; for as hence<br /> I hear and understand not, so I
      see<br /> Beneath, and naught discern."&mdash;"I answer not,"<br /> Said he,
      "but by the deed. &nbsp;To fair request<br /> Silent performance maketh
      best return."<br /> <br />We from the bridge's head descended, where<br /> To
      the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm<br /> Opening to view, I saw
      a crowd within<br /> Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape<br /> And
      hideous, that remembrance in my veins<br /> Yet shrinks the vital current.
      &nbsp;Of her sands<br /> Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,<br /> Pareas

      spirits wing'd with horrid fear,<br /> Nor hope had they of crevice where
      to hide,<br /> Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.<br /> With serpents
      were their hands behind them bound,<br /> Which through their reins infix'd
      the tail and head<br /> Twisted in folds before. &nbsp;And lo! on one<br />
      Near to our side, darted an adder up,<br /> And, where the neck is on the
      shoulders tied,<br /> Transpierc'd him. &nbsp;Far more quickly than e'er
      pen<br /> Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd<br /> To ashes, all
      pour'd out upon the earth.<br /> When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust
      again<br /> Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form<br /> Instant
      resumed. &nbsp;So mighty sages tell,<br /> The' Arabian Phoenix, when five
      hundred years<br /> Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith<br />
      Renascent. &nbsp;Blade nor herb throughout his life<br /> He tastes, but
      tears of frankincense alone<br /> And odorous amomum: swaths of nard<br />
      And myrrh his funeral shroud. &nbsp;As one that falls,<br /> He knows not
      how, by force demoniac dragg'd<br /> To earth, or through obstruction
      fettering up<br /> In chains invisible the powers of man,<br /> Who, risen
      from his trance, gazeth around,<br /> Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony<br />
      He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;<br /> So stood aghast the sinner
      when he rose.<br /> <br />Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out<br />
      Such blows in stormy vengeance! &nbsp;Who he was<br /> My teacher next
      inquir'd, and thus in few<br /> He answer'd: "Vanni Fucci am I call'd,<br />
      Not long since rained down from Tuscany<br /> To this dire gullet. &nbsp;Me
      the beastial life<br /> And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,<br />
      Who in Pistoia found my worthy den."<br /> <br />I then to Virgil: "Bid him
      stir not hence,<br /> And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once<br /> A
      man I knew him choleric and bloody."<br /> <br />The sinner heard and
      feign'd not, but towards me<br /> His mind directing and his face, wherein<br />
      Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:<br /> "It grieves me more to
      have been caught by thee<br /> In this sad plight, which thou beholdest,
      than<br /> When I was taken from the other life.<br /> I have no power
      permitted to deny<br /> What thou inquirest." &nbsp;I am doom'd thus low<br />
      To dwell, for that the sacristy by me<br /> Was rifled of its goodly
      ornaments,<br /> And with the guilt another falsely charged.<br /> But that
      thou mayst not joy to see me thus,<br /> So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this
      darksome realm<br /> Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.<br /> Reft of
      the Neri first Pistoia pines,<br /> Then Florence changeth citizens and
      laws.<br /> From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,<br /> A vapour rises,
      wrapt in turbid mists,<br /> And sharp and eager driveth on the storm<br />
      With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,<br /> Whence suddenly the cloud
      shall burst, and strike<br /> Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.<br />

      <br /> WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands<br /> Pointed in
      mockery, and cried: "Take them, God!<br /> I level them at thee!" &nbsp;From
      that day forth<br /> The serpents were my friends; for round his neck<br />
      One of then rolling twisted, as it said,<br /> "Be silent, tongue!" &nbsp;Another
      to his arms<br /> Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself<br /> So close, it
      took from them the power to move.<br /> <br />Pistoia! Ah Pistoia! why dost
      doubt<br /> To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth<br /> No longer, since
      in evil act so far<br /> Thou hast outdone thy seed? &nbsp;I did not mark,<br />
      Through all the gloomy circles of the' abyss,<br /> Spirit, that swell'd so
      proudly 'gainst his God,<br /> Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes.
      &nbsp;He fled,<br /> Nor utter'd more; and after him there came<br /> A
      centaur full of fury, shouting, "Where<br /> Where is the caitiff?" &nbsp;On
      Maremma's marsh<br /> Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch<br />
      They swarm'd, to where the human face begins.<br /> Behind his head upon
      the shoulders lay,<br /> With open wings, a dragon breathing fire<br /> On
      whomsoe'er he met. &nbsp;To me my guide:<br /> "Cacus is this, who
      underneath the rock<br /> Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.<br /> He,
      from his brethren parted, here must tread<br /> A different journey, for
      his fraudful theft<br /> Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence
      found<br /> His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace<br /> Of stout
      Alcides, that perchance laid on<br /> A hundred blows, and not the tenth
      was felt."<br /> <br />While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:<br /> And
      under us three spirits came, of whom<br /> Nor I nor he was ware, till they
      exclaim'd;<br /> "Say who are ye?" &nbsp;We then brake off discourse,<br />
      Intent on these alone. &nbsp;I knew them not;<br /> But, as it chanceth
      oft, befell, that one<br /> Had need to name another. &nbsp;"Where," said
      he,<br /> "Doth Cianfa lurk?" &nbsp;I, for a sign my guide<br /> Should
      stand attentive, plac'd against my lips<br /> The finger lifted. &nbsp;If,
      O reader! now<br /> Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,<br /> No marvel;
      for myself do scarce allow<br /> The witness of mine eyes. &nbsp;But as I
      looked<br /> Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet<br /> Springs forth on
      one, and fastens full upon him:<br /> His midmost grasp'd the belly, a
      forefoot<br /> Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek<br /> He
      flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs<br /> Were spread, 'twixt
      which the tail inserted curl'd<br /> Upon the reins behind. &nbsp;Ivy ne'er
      clasp'd<br /> A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs<br /> The hideous
      monster intertwin'd his own.<br /> Then, as they both had been of burning
      wax,<br /> Each melted into other, mingling hues,<br /> That which was
      either now was seen no more.<br /> Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it
      burns,<br /> A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,<br /> And the
      clean white expires. &nbsp;The other two<br /> Look'd on exclaiming: "Ah,
      how dost thou change,<br /> Agnello! &nbsp;See! &nbsp;Thou art nor double

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> "Nor only one." &nbsp;The two heads now became<br />
      One, and two figures blended in one form<br /> Appear'd, where both were
      lost. &nbsp;Of the four lengths<br /> Two arms were made: the belly and the
      chest<br /> The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,<br /> As never
      eye hath seen. &nbsp;Of former shape<br /> All trace was vanish'd. &nbsp;Two
      yet neither seem'd<br /> That image miscreate, and so pass'd on<br /> With
      tardy steps. &nbsp;As underneath the scourge<br /> Of the fierce dog-star,
      that lays bare the fields,<br /> Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard
      seems<br /> A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,<br /> So toward th'
      entrails of the other two<br /> Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,<br />
      As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.<br /> In that part, whence our
      life is nourish'd first,<br /> One he transpierc'd; then down before him
      fell<br /> Stretch'd out. &nbsp;The pierced spirit look'd on him<br /> But
      spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn'd,<br /> As if by sleep or
      fev'rous fit assail'd.<br /> He ey'd the serpent, and the serpent him.<br />
      One from the wound, the other from the mouth<br /> Breath'd a thick smoke,
      whose vap'ry columns join'd.<br /> <br />Lucan in mute attention now may
      hear,<br /> Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,<br /> Nor shine,
      Nasidius! &nbsp;Ovid now be mute.<br /> What if in warbling fiction he
      record<br /> Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake<br /> Him chang'd, and her into
      a fountain clear,<br /> I envy not; for never face to face<br /> Two natures
      thus transmuted did he sing,<br /> Wherein both shapes were ready to assume<br />
      The other's substance. &nbsp;They in mutual guise<br /> So answer'd, that
      the serpent split his train<br /> Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit<br />
      Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs<br /> Compacted, that no
      sign of juncture soon<br /> Was visible: the tail disparted took<br /> The
      figure which the spirit lost, its skin<br /> Soft'ning, his indurated to a
      rind.<br /> The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd<br /> The
      monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet<br /> So lengthen'd, as the
      other's dwindling shrunk.<br /> The feet behind then twisting up became<br />
      That part that man conceals, which in the wretch<br /> Was cleft in twain.
      &nbsp;While both the shadowy smoke<br /> With a new colour veils, and
      generates<br /> Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off<br /> From th'
      other body, lo! upon his feet<br /> One upright rose, and prone the other
      fell.<br /> Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps<br /> Were shifted,
      though each feature chang'd beneath.<br /> Of him who stood erect, the
      mounting face<br /> Retreated towards the temples, and what there<br />
      Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears<br /> From the smooth cheeks, the
      rest, not backward dragg'd,<br /> Of its excess did shape the nose; and
      swell'd<br /> Into due size protuberant the lips.<br /> He, on the earth who
      lay, meanwhile extends<br /> His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears<br />
      Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.<br /> His tongue continuous
      before and apt<br /> For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork<br />
      Closing unites. &nbsp;That done the smoke was laid.<br /> The soul,
      transform'd into the brute, glides off,<br /> Hissing along the vale, and
      after him<br /> The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd<br /> His
      new-grown shoulders on him, and in few<br /> Thus to another spake: "Along
      this path<br /> Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!"<br /> <br />So
      saw I fluctuate in successive change<br /> Th' unsteady ballast of the
      seventh hold:<br /> And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events<br />

      and on my thoughts amaze.<br /> <br />Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but
      well<br /> I mark'd Sciancato: he alone it was<br /> Of the three first that

      "hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd<br /> Already of the truth, already wish'd<br />
      To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes<br /> So parted at the summit,
      as it seem'd<br /> Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay<br /> The
      Theban brothers?" &nbsp;He replied: "Within<br /> Ulysses there and Diomede
      endure<br /> Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now<br /> Together
      hasting, as erewhile to wrath.<br /> These in the flame with ceaseless
      groans deplore<br /> The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide<br /> A

      question them be mine,<br /> For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,<br />
      For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee."<br /> <br />When
      there the flame had come, where time and place<br /> Seem'd fitting to my
      guide, he thus began:<br /> "O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!<br />

      on, till one of you unfold<br /> In what clime death o'ertook him
      self-destroy'd."<br /> <br />Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn<br />
      Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire<br /> That labours with the wind, then
      to and fro<br /> Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,<br /> Threw
      out its voice, and spake: "When I escap'd<br /> From Circe, who beyond a
      circling year<br /> Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,<br /> Ere thus
      Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,<br /> Nor fondness for my son, nor
      reverence<br /> Of my old father, nor return of love,<br /> That should have
      crown'd Penelope with joy,<br /> Could overcome in me the zeal I had<br />
      T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,<br /> Man's evil and his
      virtue. &nbsp;Forth I sail'd<br /> Into the deep illimitable main,<br />
      With but one bark, and the small faithful band<br /> That yet cleav'd to
      me. &nbsp;As Iberia far,<br /> Far as Morocco either shore I saw,<br /> And
      the Sardinian and each isle beside<br /> Which round that ocean bathes.
      &nbsp;Tardy with age<br /> Were I and my companions, when we came<br /> To
      the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd<br /> The bound'ries not to be
      o'erstepp'd by man.<br /> The walls of Seville to my right I left,<br /> On
      the' other hand already Ceuta past.<br /> "O brothers!" &nbsp;I began, "who
      to the west<br /> Through perils without number now have reach'd,<br /> To
      this the short remaining watch, that yet<br /> Our senses have to wake,
      refuse not proof<br /> Of the unpeopled world, following the track<br /> Of
      Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:<br /> Ye were not form'd to
      live the life of brutes<br /> But virtue to pursue and knowledge high."<br />
      With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage<br /> The mind of my
      associates, that I then<br /> Could scarcely have withheld them. &nbsp;To
      the dawn<br /> Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight<br /> Made our
      oars wings, still gaining on the left.<br /> Each star of the' other pole

      underneath the moon<br /> Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far<br />
      Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought<br /> Of all I e'er beheld.
      &nbsp;Joy seiz'd us straight,<br /> But soon to mourning changed. &nbsp;From
      the new land<br /> A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side<br /> Did
      strike the vessel. &nbsp;Thrice it whirl'd her round<br /> With all the
      waves, the fourth time lifted up<br /> The poop, and sank the prow: so fate
      decreed:<br /> And over us the booming billow clos'd." <br /><br /> <a

      absolve thee. &nbsp;In return,<br /> Teach me my purpose so to execute,<br />
      That Penestrino cumber earth no more.<br /> Heav'n, as thou knowest, I have

      which my predecessor meanly priz'd."<br /> <br />Then, yielding to the
      forceful arguments,<br /> Of silence as more perilous I deem'd,<br /> And
      answer'd: "Father! since thou washest me<br /> Clear of that guilt wherein
      I now must fall,<br /> Large promise with performance scant, be sure,<br />
      Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat."<br /> <br />"When I was number'd
      with the dead, then came<br /> Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark<br />
      He met, who cried: "'Wrong me not; he is mine,<br /> And must below to join
      the wretched crew,<br /> For the deceitful counsel which he gave.<br /> E'er

      contradiction absolute forbid."<br /> Oh mis'ry! how I shook myself, when
      he<br /> Seiz'd me, and cried, "Thou haply thought'st me not<br /> A
      disputant in logic so exact."<br /> To Minos down he bore me, and the judge<br />
      Twin'd eight times round his callous back the tail,<br /> Which biting with
      excess of rage, he spake:<br /> 'This is a guilty soul, that in the fire<br />
      Must vanish.' &nbsp;Hence perdition-doom'd I rove<br /> A prey to rankling

      &nbsp;One I saw<br /> In fashion like a lute, had but the groin<br /> Been
      sever'd, where it meets the forked part.<br /> Swoln dropsy,
      disproportioning the limbs<br /> With ill-converted moisture, that the
      paunch<br /> Suits not the visage, open'd wide his lips<br /> Gasping as in
      the hectic man for drought,<br /> One towards the chin, the other upward
      curl'd.<br /> <br />"O ye, who in this world of misery,<br /> Wherefore I
      know not, are exempt from pain,"<br /> Thus he began, "attentively regard<br />

      most I coveted;<br /> One drop of water now, alas! I crave.<br /> The rills,
      that glitter down the grassy slopes<br /> Of Casentino, making fresh and
      soft<br /> The banks whereby they glide to Arno's stream,<br /> Stand ever
      in my view; and not in vain;<br /> For more the pictur'd semblance dries me
      up,<br /> Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh<br /> Desert
      these shrivel'd cheeks. &nbsp;So from the place,<br /> Where I
      transgress'd, stern justice urging me,<br /> Takes means to quicken more my
      lab'ring sighs.<br /> There is Romena, where I falsified<br /> The metal

      burnt.<br /> But if I here might see the sorrowing soul<br /> Of Guido,
      Alessandro, or their brother,<br /> For Branda's limpid spring I would not
      change<br /> The welcome sight. &nbsp;One is e'en now within,<br /> If truly

      besteads me that?<br /> My limbs are fetter'd. &nbsp;Were I but so light,<br />

      stamp'd<br /> The florens with three carats of alloy."<br /> <br />"Who are
      that abject pair," I next inquir'd,<br /> "That closely bounding thee upon
      thy right<br /> Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep'd<br /> In the
      chill stream?"&mdash;"When to this gulf I dropt,"<br /> He answer'd, "here
      I found them; since that hour<br /> They have not turn'd, nor ever shall, I
      ween,<br /> Till time hath run his course. &nbsp;One is that dame<br /> The
      false accuser of the Hebrew youth;<br /> Sinon the other, that false Greek

      cloud upsteam'd." &nbsp;When that he heard,<br /> One, gall'd perchance to
      be so darkly nam'd,<br /> With clench'd hand smote him on the braced
      paunch,<br /> That like a drum resounded: but forthwith<br /> Adamo smote
      him on the face, the blow<br /> Returning with his arm, that seem'd as
      hard.<br /> <br />"Though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me<br /> The
      power to move," said he, "I have an arm<br /> At liberty for such employ."
      &nbsp;To whom<br /> Was answer'd: "When thou wentest to the fire,<br /> Thou
      hadst it not so ready at command,<br /> Then readier when it coin'd th'
      impostor gold."<br /> <br />And thus the dropsied: "Ay, now speak'st thou
      true.<br /> But there thou gav'st not such true testimony,<br /> When thou
      wast question'd of the truth, at Troy."<br /> <br />"If I spake false, thou
      falsely stamp'dst the coin,"<br /> Said Sinon; "I am here but for one
      fault,<br /> And thou for more than any imp beside."<br /> <br />"Remember,"
      he replied, "O perjur'd one,<br /> The horse remember, that did teem with
      death,<br /> And all the world be witness to thy guilt."<br /> <br />"To
      thine," return'd the Greek, "witness the thirst<br /> Whence thy tongue
      cracks, witness the fluid mound,<br /> Rear'd by thy belly up before thine
      eyes,<br /> A mass corrupt." &nbsp;To whom the coiner thus:<br /> "Thy mouth
      gapes wide as ever to let pass<br /> Its evil saying. &nbsp;Me if thirst
      assails,<br /> Yet I am stuff'd with moisture. &nbsp;Thou art parch'd,<br />
      Pains rack thy head, no urging would'st thou need<br /> To make thee lap
      Narcissus' mirror up."<br /> <br />I was all fix'd to listen, when my guide<br />
      Admonish'd: "Now beware: a little more.<br /> And I do quarrel with thee."
      &nbsp;I perceiv'd<br /> How angrily he spake, and towards him turn'd<br />
      With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet<br /> Confounds me. &nbsp;As a
      man that dreams of harm<br /> Befall'n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,<br />

      wanting power to speak<br /> Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while<br />
      Excus'd me, though unweeting that I did.<br /> <br />"More grievous fault
      than thine has been, less shame,"<br /> My master cried, "might expiate.
      &nbsp;Therefore cast<br /> All sorrow from thy soul; and if again<br />

      <br /> THE very tongue, whose keen reproof before<br /> Had wounded me, that
      either cheek was stain'd,<br /> Now minister'd my cure. &nbsp;So have I
      heard,<br /> Achilles and his father's javelin caus'd<br /> Pain first, and
      then the boon of health restor'd.<br /> <br />Turning our back upon the vale
      of woe,<br /> W cross'd th' encircled mound in silence. &nbsp;There<br />
      Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom<br /> Mine eye advanc'd not: but
      I heard a horn<br /> Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made<br /> The
      thunder feeble. &nbsp;Following its course<br /> The adverse way, my
      strained eyes were bent<br /> On that one spot. &nbsp;So terrible a blast<br />
      Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout<br /> O'erthrew the host of
      Charlemagne, and quench'd<br /> His saintly warfare. &nbsp;Thitherward not
      long<br /> My head was rais'd, when many lofty towers<br /> Methought I
      spied. &nbsp;"Master," said I, "what land<br /> Is this?" &nbsp;He answer'd
      straight: "Too long a space<br /> Of intervening darkness has thine eye<br />
      To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err'd<br /> In thy imagining.
      &nbsp;Thither arriv'd<br /> Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude<br />
      The sense. &nbsp;A little therefore urge thee on."<br /> <br />Then tenderly
      he caught me by the hand;<br /> "Yet know," said he, "ere farther we
      advance,<br /> That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,<br />
      But giants. &nbsp;In the pit they stand immers'd,<br /> Each from his navel
      downward, round the bank."<br /> <br />As when a fog disperseth gradually,<br />
      Our vision traces what the mist involves<br /> Condens'd in air; so
      piercing through the gross<br /> And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more<br />
      We near'd toward the brink, mine error fled,<br /> And fear came o'er me.
      &nbsp;As with circling round<br /> Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his
      walls,<br /> E'en thus the shore, encompassing th' abyss,<br /> Was turreted
      with giants, half their length<br /> Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from
      heav'n<br /> Yet threatens, when his mutt'ring thunder rolls.<br /> <br />Of
      one already I descried the face,<br /> Shoulders, and breast, and of the
      belly huge<br /> Great part, and both arms down along his ribs.<br /> <br />All-teeming
      nature, when her plastic hand<br /> Left framing of these monsters, did
      display<br /> Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War<br /> Such slaves
      to do his bidding; and if she<br /> Repent her not of th' elephant and
      whale,<br /> Who ponders well confesses her therein<br /> Wiser and more
      discreet; for when brute force<br /> And evil will are back'd with
      subtlety,<br /> Resistance none avails. &nbsp;His visage seem'd<br /> In
      length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops<br /> Saint Peter's Roman
      fane; and th' other bones<br /> Of like proportion, so that from above<br />
      The bank, which girdled him below, such height<br /> Arose his stature,
      that three Friezelanders<br /> Had striv'n in vain to reach but to his
      hair.<br /> Full thirty ample palms was he expos'd<br /> Downward from
      whence a man his garments loops.<br /> "Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,"<br />
      So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns<br /> Became not; and my
      guide address'd him thus:<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> "O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee<br />
      Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage<br /> Or other passion wring
      thee. &nbsp;Search thy neck,<br /> There shalt thou find the belt that
      binds it on.<br /> Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast<br /> Where hangs
      the baldrick!" &nbsp;Then to me he spake:<br /> "He doth accuse himself.

      Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,<br /> Now moves he
      never." &nbsp;Forthwith I return'd:<br /> "Fain would I, if 't were
      possible, mine eyes<br /> Of Briareus immeasurable gain'd<br /> Experience
      next." &nbsp;He answer'd: "Thou shalt see<br /> Not far from hence Antaeus,
      who both speaks<br /> And is unfetter'd, who shall place us there<br />
      Where guilt is at its depth. &nbsp;Far onward stands<br /> Whom thou
      wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made<br /> Like to this spirit, save
      that in his looks<br /> More fell he seems." &nbsp;By violent earthquake
      rock'd<br /> Ne'er shook a tow'r, so reeling to its base,<br /> As
      Ephialtes. &nbsp;More than ever then<br /> I dreaded death, nor than the
      terror more<br /> Had needed, if I had not seen the cords<br /> That held
      him fast. &nbsp;We, straightway journeying on,<br /> Came to Antaeus, who
      five ells complete<br /> Without the head, forth issued from the cave.<br />
      <br />"O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made<br /> Great Scipio heir
      of glory, when his sword<br /> Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,<br />
      Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil<br /> An hundred lions; and if
      thou hadst fought<br /> In the high conflict on thy brethren's side,<br />
      Seems as men yet believ'd, that through thine arm<br /> The sons of earth
      had conquer'd, now vouchsafe<br /> To place us down beneath, where numbing
      cold<br /> Locks up Cocytus. &nbsp;Force not that we crave<br /> Or Tityus'
      help or Typhon's. &nbsp;Here is one<br /> Can give what in this realm ye
      covet. &nbsp;Stoop<br /> Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip.<br /> He
      in the upper world can yet bestow<br /> Renown on thee, for he doth live,
      and looks<br /> For life yet longer, if before the time<br /> Grace call him
      not unto herself." &nbsp;Thus spake<br /> The teacher. &nbsp;He in haste
      forth stretch'd his hands,<br /> And caught my guide. &nbsp;Alcides whilom
      felt<br /> That grapple straighten'd score. &nbsp;Soon as my guide<br /> Had
      felt it, he bespake me thus: "This way<br /> That I may clasp thee;" then
      so caught me up,<br /> That we were both one burden. &nbsp;As appears<br />
      The tower of Carisenda, from beneath<br /> Where it doth lean, if chance a
      passing cloud<br /> So sail across, that opposite it hangs,<br /> Such then
      Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease<br /> I mark'd him stooping. &nbsp;I were
      fain at times<br /> T' have pass'd another way. &nbsp;Yet in th' abyss,<br />
      That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,<br /> lightly he plac'd us; nor there
      leaning stay'd,<br /> But rose as in a bark the stately mast. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.<br /> <br />And one, from whom the

      but thou must bark outright?<br /> "What devil wrings thee?"&mdash;"Now,"
      said I, "be dumb,<br /> Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee<br /> True
      tidings will I bear."&mdash;"Off," he replied,<br /> "Tell what thou list;
      but as thou escape from hence<br /> To speak of him whose tongue hath been
      so glib,<br /> Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.<br /> 'Him of

      beheld two spirits by the ice<br /> Pent in one hollow, that the head of

      <br /> HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,<br /> That sinner wip'd
      them on the hairs o' th' head,<br /> Which he behind had mangled, then
      began:<br /> "Thy will obeying, I call up afresh<br /> Sorrow past cure,
      which but to think of wrings<br /> My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if
      words,<br /> That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear<br /> Fruit of
      eternal infamy to him,<br /> The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once<br />
      Shalt see me speak and weep. &nbsp;Who thou mayst be<br /> I know not, nor
      how here below art come:<br /> But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,<br />
      When I do hear thee. &nbsp;Know I was on earth<br /> Count Ugolino, and th'
      Archbishop he<br /> Ruggieri. &nbsp;Why I neighbour him so close,<br /> Now
      list. &nbsp;That through effect of his ill thoughts<br /> In him my trust
      reposing, I was ta'en<br /> And after murder'd, need is not I tell.<br />
      What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,<br /> How cruel was the
      murder, shalt thou hear,<br /> And know if he have wrong'd me. &nbsp;A
      small grate<br /> Within that mew, which for my sake the name<br /> Of
      famine bears, where others yet must pine,<br /> Already through its opening
      sev'ral moons<br /> Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,<br /> That
      from the future tore the curtain off.<br /> This one, methought, as master
      of the sport,<br /> Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps<br />
      Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight<br /> Of Lucca to the Pisan.
      &nbsp;With lean brachs<br /> Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd<br />
      Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.<br /> After short course the father
      and the sons<br /> Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw<br /> The
      sharp tusks gore their sides. &nbsp;When I awoke<br /> Before the dawn,
      amid their sleep I heard<br /> My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask<br />
      For bread. &nbsp;Right cruel art thou, if no pang<br /> Thou feel at
      thinking what my heart foretold;<br /> And if not now, why use thy tears to
      flow?<br /> Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near<br /> When they
      were wont to bring us food; the mind<br /> Of each misgave him through his
      dream, and I<br /> Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up<br /> The'
      horrible tower: whence uttering not a word<br /> I look'd upon the visage
      of my sons.<br /> I wept not: so all stone I felt within.<br /> They wept:
      and one, my little Anslem, cried:<br /> 'Thou lookest so! &nbsp;Father what
      ails thee?' &nbsp;Yet<br /> I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day<br />
      Nor the next night, until another sun<br /> Came out upon the world. &nbsp;When
      a faint beam<br /> Had to our doleful prison made its way,<br /> And in four
      countenances I descry'd<br /> The image of my own, on either hand<br />
      Through agony I bit, and they who thought<br /> I did it through desire of
      feeding, rose<br /> O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve<br />
      Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st<br /> These weeds of

      day and the next<br /> We all were silent. &nbsp;Ah, obdurate earth!<br />
      Why open'dst not upon us? &nbsp;When we came<br /> To the fourth day, then
      Geddo at my feet<br /> Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help<br />
      For me, my father!' &nbsp;There he died, and e'en<br /> Plainly as thou

      fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone<br /> Firm and unyielding.
      &nbsp;Oh thou Pisa! shame<br /> Of all the people, who their dwelling make<br />
      In that fair region, where th' Italian voice<br /> Is heard, since that thy
      neighbours are so slack<br /> To punish, from their deep foundations rise<br />
      Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up<br /> The mouth of Arno, that each soul in
      thee<br /> May perish in the waters! &nbsp;What if fame<br /> Reported that
      thy castles were betray'd<br /> By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou<br /> To
      stretch his children on the rack. &nbsp;For them,<br /> Brigata, Ugaccione,
      and the pair<br /> Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,<br /> Their
      tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make<br /> Uncapable of guilt. &nbsp;Onward
      we pass'd,<br /> Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice<br /> Not on
      their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd.<br /> <br />There very weeping
      suffers not to weep;<br /> For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds<br />
      Impediment, and rolling inward turns<br /> For increase of sharp anguish:
      the first tears<br /> Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,<br />
      Under the socket brimming all the cup.<br /> <br />Now though the cold had
      from my face dislodg'd<br /> Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me
      seem'd<br /> Some breath of wind I felt. &nbsp;"Whence cometh this,"<br />
      Said I, "my master? &nbsp;Is not here below<br /> All vapour quench'd?"&mdash;"'Thou
      shalt be speedily,"<br /> He answer'd, "where thine eye shall tell thee
      whence<br /> The cause descrying of this airy shower."<br /> <br />Then cried
      out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:<br /> "O souls so cruel! that the
      farthest post<br /> Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove<br /> The
      harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief<br /> Impregnate at my heart, some
      little space<br /> Ere it congeal again!" &nbsp;I thus replied:<br /> "Say
      who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;<br /> And if I extricate thee
      not, far down<br /> As to the lowest ice may I descend!"<br /> <br />"The
      friar Alberigo," answered he,<br /> "Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd<br />
      Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date<br /> More luscious for my fig."&mdash;"Hah!"
      &nbsp;I exclaim'd,<br /> "Art thou too dead!"&mdash;"How in the world aloft<br />
      It fareth with my body," answer'd he,<br /> "I am right ignorant. &nbsp;Such
      privilege<br /> Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul<br /> Drops hither,
      ere by Atropos divorc'd.<br /> And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly<br />
      The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,<br /> Know that the soul,
      that moment she betrays,<br /> As I did, yields her body to a fiend<br />
      Who after moves and governs it at will,<br /> Till all its time be rounded;
      headlong she<br /> Falls to this cistern. &nbsp;And perchance above<br />
      Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,<br /> Who here behind me winters.
      &nbsp;Him thou know'st,<br /> If thou but newly art arriv'd below.<br /> The
      years are many that have pass'd away,<br /> Since to this fastness Branca
      Doria came."<br /> <br />"Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me,<br />
      For Branca Doria never yet hath died,<br /> But doth all natural functions
      of a man,<br /> Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."<br />
      <br />He thus: "Not yet unto that upper foss<br /> By th' evil talons
      guarded, where the pitch<br /> Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,<br />
      When this one left a demon in his stead<br /> In his own body, and of one
      his kin,<br /> Who with him treachery wrought. &nbsp;But now put forth<br />
      Thy hand, and ope mine eyes." &nbsp;I op'd them not.<br /> Ill manners were
      best courtesy to him.<br /> <br />Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,<br />
      With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth<br /> Are ye not cancel'd?
      &nbsp;Such an one of yours<br /> I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,<br />
      As for his doings even now in soul<br /> Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet
      doth seem<br /> In body still alive upon the earth. <br /><br /> <a name="link34"></a>

    <p>
      <br /> "THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth<br /> Towards us;
      therefore look," so spake my guide,<br /> "If thou discern him." &nbsp;As,
      when breathes a cloud<br /> Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night<br />
      Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far<br /> A windmill, which the
      blast stirs briskly round,<br /> Such was the fabric then methought I saw,<br />
      <br />To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew<br /> Behind my guide: no
      covert else was there.<br /> <br />Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain<br />
      Record the marvel) where the souls were all<br /> Whelm'd underneath,
      transparent, as through glass<br /> Pellucid the frail stem. &nbsp;Some
      prone were laid,<br /> Others stood upright, this upon the soles,<br /> That
      on his head, a third with face to feet<br /> Arch'd like a bow. &nbsp;When
      to the point we came,<br /> Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see<br />
      The creature eminent in beauty once,<br /> He from before me stepp'd and
      made me pause.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="images/34-323.jpg">ENLARGE

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />"Lo!" &nbsp;he exclaim'd, "lo Dis! and lo the
      place,<br /> Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."<br />
      <br />How frozen and how faint I then became,<br /> Ask me not, reader! for
      I write it not,<br /> Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.<br />
      I was not dead nor living. &nbsp;Think thyself<br /> If quick conception
      work in thee at all,<br /> How I did feel. &nbsp;That emperor, who sways<br />
      The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice<br /> Stood forth; and I in
      stature am more like<br /> A giant, than the giants are in his arms.<br />
      Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits<br /> With such a part.
      &nbsp;If he were beautiful<br /> As he is hideous now, and yet did dare<br />
      To scowl upon his Maker, well from him<br /> May all our mis'ry flow.
      &nbsp;Oh what a sight!<br /> How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy<br />
      Upon his head three faces: one in front<br /> Of hue vermilion, th' other
      two with this<br /> Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;<br /> The
      right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left<br /> To look on, such as come
      from whence old Nile<br /> Stoops to the lowlands. &nbsp;Under each shot
      forth<br /> Two mighty wings, enormous as became<br /> A bird so vast.
      &nbsp;Sails never such I saw<br /> Outstretch'd on the wide sea. &nbsp;No
      plumes had they,<br /> But were in texture like a bat, and these<br /> He
      flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still<br /> Three winds, wherewith
      Cocytus to its depth<br /> Was frozen. &nbsp;At six eyes he wept: the tears<br />
      Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.<br /> At every mouth his
      teeth a sinner champ'd<br /> Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that
      three<br /> Were in this guise tormented. &nbsp;But far more<br /> Than from
      that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd<br /> By the fierce rending, whence
      ofttimes the back<br /> Was stript of all its skin. &nbsp;"That upper
      spirit,<br /> Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,<br /> "Is
      Judas, he that hath his head within<br /> And plies the feet without.
      &nbsp;Of th' other two,<br /> Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw<br />
      Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe<br /> And speaks not! &nbsp;Th'
      other Cassius, that appears<br /> So large of limb. &nbsp;But night now
      re-ascends,<br /> And it is time for parting. &nbsp;All is seen."<br />
      <br />I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;<br /> And noting time
      and place, he, when the wings<br /> Enough were op'd, caught fast the
      shaggy sides,<br /> And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd<br />
      Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.<br /> <br />Soon as he reach'd
      the point, whereat the thigh<br /> Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,<br />
      My leader there with pain and struggling hard<br /> Turn'd round his head,
      where his feet stood before,<br /> And grappled at the fell, as one who
      mounts,<br /> That into hell methought we turn'd again.<br /> <br />"Expect
      that by such stairs as these," thus spake<br /> The teacher, panting like a
      man forespent,<br /> "We must depart from evil so extreme."<br /> Then at a
      rocky opening issued forth,<br /> And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next
      join'd<br /> With wary step my side. &nbsp;I rais'd mine eyes,<br />
      Believing that I Lucifer should see<br /> Where he was lately left, but saw
      him now<br /> With legs held upward. &nbsp;Let the grosser sort,<br /> Who
      see not what the point was I had pass'd,<br /> Bethink them if sore toil
      oppress'd me then.<br /> <br />"Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.<br />
      The way is long, and much uncouth the road;<br /> And now within one hour
      and half of noon<br /> The sun returns." &nbsp;It was no palace-hall<br />
      Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,<br /> But natural dungeon where ill
      footing was<br /> And scant supply of light. &nbsp;"Ere from th' abyss<br />
      I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,<br /> "My guide! vouchsafe few words
      to set me free<br /> From error's thralldom. &nbsp;Where is now the ice?<br />
      How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?<br /> And how from eve to morn in
      space so brief<br /> Hath the sun made his transit?" &nbsp;He in few<br />
      Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still<br /> On th' other side
      the centre, where I grasp'd<br /> Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through
      the world.<br /> Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I<br /> Descended;
      when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass<br /> That point, to which from ev'ry
      part is dragg'd<br /> All heavy substance. &nbsp;Thou art now arriv'd<br />
      Under the hemisphere opposed to that,<br /> Which the great continent doth
      overspread,<br /> And underneath whose canopy expir'd<br /> The Man, that
      was born sinless, and so liv'd.<br /> Thy feet are planted on the smallest
      sphere,<br /> Whose other aspect is Judecca. &nbsp;Morn<br /> Here rises,
      when there evening sets: and he,<br /> Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet
      standeth fix'd,<br /> As at the first. &nbsp;On this part he fell down<br />
      From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,<br /> Through fear of
      him did veil her with the sea,<br /> And to our hemisphere retir'd. &nbsp;Perchance<br />
      To shun him was the vacant space left here<br /> By what of firm land on
      this side appears,<br /> That sprang aloof." &nbsp;There is a place
      beneath,<br /> From Belzebub as distant, as extends<br /> The vaulted tomb,
      discover'd not by sight,<br /> But by the sound of brooklet, that descends<br />
      This way along the hollow of a rock,<br /> Which, as it winds with no
      precipitous course,<br /> The wave hath eaten. &nbsp;By that hidden way<br />
      My guide and I did enter, to return<br /> To the fair world: and heedless
      of repose<br /> We climbed, he first, I following his steps,<br /> Till on
      our view the beautiful lights of heav'n<br /> Dawn'd through a circular
      opening in the cave:<br /> Thus issuing we again beheld the stars. <br /><br /><br /><br />

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
