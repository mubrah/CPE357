      CANTO I

    <p>
      <br /> His glory, by whose might all things are mov'd,<br /> Pierces the
      universe, and in one part<br /> Sheds more resplendence, elsewhere less.
      &nbsp;In heav'n,<br /> That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,<br />
      Witness of things, which to relate again<br /> Surpasseth power of him who
      comes from thence;<br /> For that, so near approaching its desire<br /> Our
      intellect is to such depth absorb'd,<br /> That memory cannot follow.
      &nbsp;Nathless all,<br /> That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm<br />
      Could store, shall now be matter of my song.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benign
      Apollo! this last labour aid,<br /> And make me such a vessel of thy worth,<br />
      As thy own laurel claims of me belov'd.<br /> Thus far hath one of steep
      Parnassus' brows<br /> Suffic'd me; henceforth there is need of both<br />
      For my remaining enterprise Do thou<br /> Enter into my bosom, and there
      breathe<br /> So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'd<br /> Forth from
      his limbs unsheath'd. &nbsp;O power divine!<br /> If thou to me of shine
      impart so much,<br /> That of that happy realm the shadow'd form<br />
      Trac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view,<br /> Thou shalt behold me
      of thy favour'd tree<br /> Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;<br />
      For to that honour thou, and my high theme<br /> Will fit me. &nbsp;If but
      seldom, mighty Sire!<br /> To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath<br />
      Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills<br /> Deprav'd) joy to the
      Delphic god must spring<br /> From the Pierian foliage, when one breast<br />
      Is with such thirst inspir'd. &nbsp;From a small spark<br /> Great flame
      hath risen: after me perchance<br /> Others with better voice may pray, and
      gain<br /> From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
      diver passages, the world's bright lamp<br /> Rises to mortals, but through
      that which joins<br /> Four circles with the threefold cross, in best<br />
      Course, and in happiest constellation set<br /> He comes, and to the
      worldly wax best gives<br /> Its temper and impression. &nbsp;Morning
      there,<br /> Here eve was by almost such passage made;<br /> And whiteness
      had o'erspread that hemisphere,<br /> Blackness the other part; when to the
      left<br /> I saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun<br /> Gazing, as never
      eagle fix'd his ken.<br /> As from the first a second beam is wont<br /> To
      issue, and reflected upwards rise,<br /> E'en as a pilgrim bent on his
      return,<br /> So of her act, that through the eyesight pass'd<br /> Into my
      fancy, mine was form'd; and straight,<br /> Beyond our mortal wont, I fix'd
      mine eyes<br /> Upon the sun. &nbsp;Much is allowed us there,<br /> That
      here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the place<br /> Made for the dwelling of
      the human kind<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suffer'd it not
      long, and yet so long<br /> That I beheld it bick'ring sparks around,<br />
      As iron that comes boiling from the fire.<br /> And suddenly upon the day
      appear'd<br /> A day new-ris'n, as he, who hath the power,<br /> Had with
      another sun bedeck'd the sky.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
      eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels,<br /> Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I
      with ken<br /> Fix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'd<br /> At her aspect,
      such inwardly became<br /> As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,<br />
      That made him peer among the ocean gods;<br /> Words may not tell of that
      transhuman change:<br /> And therefore let the example serve, though weak,<br />
      For those whom grace hath better proof in store<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
      I were only what thou didst create,<br /> Then newly, Love! by whom the
      heav'n is rul'd,<br /> Thou know'st, who by thy light didst bear me up.<br />
      Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,<br /> Desired Spirit! with its
      harmony<br /> Temper'd of thee and measur'd, charm'd mine ear,<br /> Then
      seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blaze<br /> With the sun's flame, that
      rain or flood ne'er made<br /> A lake so broad. &nbsp;The newness of the
      sound,<br /> And that great light, inflam'd me with desire,<br /> Keener
      than e'er was felt, to know their cause.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence
      she who saw me, clearly as myself,<br /> To calm my troubled mind, before I
      ask'd,<br /> Open'd her lips, and gracious thus began:<br /> "With false
      imagination thou thyself<br /> Mak'st dull, so that thou seest not the
      thing,<br /> Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off.<br /> Thou art
      not on the earth as thou believ'st;<br /> For light'ning scap'd from its
      own proper place<br /> Ne'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd."<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although divested of my first-rais'd
      doubt,<br /> By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,<br /> Yet in new
      doubt was I entangled more,<br /> And said: "Already satisfied, I rest<br />
      From admiration deep, but now admire<br /> How I above those lighter bodies
      rise."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence, after utt'rance of
      a piteous sigh,<br /> She tow'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,<br />
      As on her frenzied child a mother casts;<br /> Then thus began: "Among
      themselves all things<br /> Have order; and from hence the form, which
      makes<br /> The universe resemble God. &nbsp;In this<br /> The higher
      creatures see the printed steps<br /> Of that eternal worth, which is the
      end<br /> Whither the line is drawn. &nbsp;All natures lean,<br /> In this
      their order, diversely, some more,<br /> Some less approaching to their
      primal source.<br /> Thus they to different havens are mov'd on<br />
      Through the vast sea of being, and each one<br /> With instinct giv'n, that
      bears it in its course;<br /> This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,<br />
      This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,<br /> This the brute earth
      together knits, and binds.<br /> Nor only creatures, void of intellect,<br />
      Are aim'd at by this bow; but even those,<br /> That have intelligence and
      love, are pierc'd.<br /> That Providence, who so well orders all,<br /> With
      her own light makes ever calm the heaven,<br /> In which the substance,
      that hath greatest speed,<br /> Is turn'd: and thither now, as to our seat<br />
      Predestin'd, we are carried by the force<br /> Of that strong cord, that
      never looses dart,<br /> But at fair aim and glad. &nbsp;Yet is it true,<br />
      That as ofttimes but ill accords the form<br /> To the design of art,
      through sluggishness<br /> Of unreplying matter, so this course<br /> Is
      sometimes quitted by the creature, who<br /> Hath power, directed thus, to
      bend elsewhere;<br /> As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,<br /> From
      its original impulse warp'd, to earth,<br /> By vicious fondness. &nbsp;Thou
      no more admire<br /> Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse<br /> Of
      torrent downwards from a mountain's height.<br /> There would in thee for
      wonder be more cause,<br /> If, free of hind'rance, thou hadst fix'd
      thyself<br /> Below, like fire unmoving on the earth."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
      said, she turn'd toward the heav'n her face. <br /><br /> <a name="link2"

    <h2>
      CANTO II
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> All ye, who in small bark have following sail'd,<br /> Eager to
      listen, on the advent'rous track<br /> Of my proud keel, that singing cuts
      its way,<br /> Backward return with speed, and your own shores<br />
      Revisit, nor put out to open sea,<br /> Where losing me, perchance ye may
      remain<br /> Bewilder'd in deep maze. &nbsp;The way I pass<br /> Ne'er yet
      was run: Minerva breathes the gale,<br /> Apollo guides me, and another
      Nine<br /> To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.<br /> Ye other few, who
      have outstretch'd the neck.<br /> Timely for food of angels, on which here<br />
      They live, yet never know satiety,<br /> Through the deep brine ye fearless
      may put out<br /> Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad<br /> Before
      you in the wave, that on both sides<br /> Equal returns. &nbsp;Those,
      glorious, who pass'd o'er<br /> To Colchos, wonder'd not as ye will do,<br />
      When they saw Jason following the plough.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      increate perpetual thirst, that draws<br /> Toward the realm of God's own
      form, bore us<br /> Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatrice
      upward gaz'd, and I on her,<br /> And in such space as on the notch a dart<br />
      Is plac'd, then loosen'd flies, I saw myself<br /> Arriv'd, where wond'rous
      thing engag'd my sight.<br /> Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,<br />
      Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair,<br /> Bespake me: "Gratefully
      direct thy mind<br /> To God, through whom to this first star we come."<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us,<br />
      Translucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright,<br /> Like adamant, which
      the sun's beam had smit<br /> Within itself the ever-during pearl<br />
      Receiv'd us, as the wave a ray of light<br /> Receives, and rests unbroken.
      &nbsp;If I then<br /> Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend<br /> Our
      weaker thought, how one dimension thus<br /> Another could endure, which
      needs must be<br /> If body enter body, how much more<br /> Must the desire
      inflame us to behold<br /> That essence, which discovers by what means<br />
      God and our nature join'd! &nbsp;There will be seen<br /> That which we
      hold through faith, not shown by proof,<br /> But in itself intelligibly
      plain,<br /> E'en as the truth that man at first believes.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
      answered: "Lady! I with thoughts devout,<br /> Such as I best can frame,
      give thanks to Him,<br /> Who hath remov'd me from the mortal world.<br />
      But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots<br /> Upon this body, which
      below on earth<br /> Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?"<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She somewhat smil'd, then spake: "If
      mortals err<br /> In their opinion, when the key of sense<br /> Unlocks not,
      surely wonder's weapon keen<br /> Ought not to pierce thee; since thou
      find'st, the wings<br /> Of reason to pursue the senses' flight<br /> Are
      short. &nbsp;But what thy own thought is, declare."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
      I: "What various here above appears,<br /> Is caus'd, I deem, by bodies
      dense or rare."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She then resum'd:
      "Thou certainly wilt see<br /> In falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if well<br />
      Thou listen to the arguments, which I<br /> Shall bring to face it. &nbsp;The
      eighth sphere displays<br /> Numberless lights, the which in kind and size<br />
      May be remark'd of different aspects;<br /> If rare or dense of that were
      cause alone,<br /> One single virtue then would be in all,<br /> Alike
      distributed, or more, or less.<br /> Different virtues needs must be the
      fruits<br /> Of formal principles, and these, save one,<br /> Will by thy
      reasoning be destroy'd. &nbsp;Beside,<br /> If rarity were of that dusk the
      cause,<br /> Which thou inquirest, either in some part<br /> That planet
      must throughout be void, nor fed<br /> With its own matter; or, as bodies
      share<br /> Their fat and leanness, in like manner this<br /> Must in its
      volume change the leaves. &nbsp;The first,<br /> If it were true, had
      through the sun's eclipse<br /> Been manifested, by transparency<br /> Of
      light, as through aught rare beside effus'd.<br /> But this is not. &nbsp;Therefore
      remains to see<br /> The other cause: and if the other fall,<br /> Erroneous
      so must prove what seem'd to thee.<br /> If not from side to side this
      rarity<br /> Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence<br /> Its
      contrary no further lets it pass.<br /> And hence the beam, that from
      without proceeds,<br /> Must be pour'd back, as colour comes, through glass<br />
      Reflected, which behind it lead conceals.<br /> Now wilt thou say, that
      there of murkier hue<br /> Than in the other part the ray is shown,<br /> By
      being thence refracted farther back.<br /> From this perplexity will free
      thee soon<br /> Experience, if thereof thou trial make,<br /> The fountain
      whence your arts derive their streame.<br /> Three mirrors shalt thou take,
      and two remove<br /> From thee alike, and more remote the third.<br />
      Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;<br /> Then turn'd toward
      them, cause behind thy back<br /> A light to stand, that on the three shall
      shine,<br /> And thus reflected come to thee from all.<br /> Though that
      beheld most distant do not stretch<br /> A space so ample, yet in
      brightness thou<br /> Will own it equaling the rest. &nbsp;But now,<br /> As
      under snow the ground, if the warm ray<br /> Smites it, remains dismantled
      of the hue<br /> And cold, that cover'd it before, so thee,<br /> Dismantled
      in thy mind, I will inform<br /> With light so lively, that the tremulous
      beam<br /> Shall quiver where it falls. &nbsp;Within the heaven,<br /> Where
      peace divine inhabits, circles round<br /> A body, in whose virtue dies the
      being<br /> Of all that it contains. &nbsp;The following heaven,<br /> That
      hath so many lights, this being divides,<br /> Through &nbsp;different
      essences, from it distinct,<br /> And yet contain'd within it. &nbsp;The
      other orbs<br /> Their separate distinctions variously<br /> Dispose, for
      their own seed and produce apt.<br /> Thus do these organs of the world
      proceed,<br /> As thou beholdest now, from step to step,<br /> Their
      influences from above deriving,<br /> And thence transmitting downwards.
      &nbsp;Mark me well,<br /> How through this passage to the truth I ford,<br />
      The truth thou lov'st, that thou henceforth alone,<br /> May'st know to
      keep the shallows, safe, untold.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The
      virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,<br /> As mallet by the workman's
      hand, must needs<br /> By blessed movers be inspir'd. &nbsp;This heaven,<br />
      Made beauteous by so many luminaries,<br /> From the deep spirit, that
      moves its circling sphere,<br /> Its image takes an impress as a seal:<br />
      And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,<br /> Through members
      different, yet together form'd,<br /> In different pow'rs resolves itself;
      e'en so<br /> The intellectual efficacy unfolds<br /> Its goodness
      multiplied throughout the stars;<br /> On its own unity revolving still.<br />
      Different virtue compact different<br /> Makes with the precious body it
      enlivens,<br /> With which it knits, as life in you is knit.<br /> From its
      original nature full of joy,<br /> The virtue mingled through the body
      shines,<br /> As joy through pupil of the living eye.<br /> From hence
      proceeds, that which from light to light<br /> Seems different, and not
      from dense or rare.<br /> This is the formal cause, that generates<br />

      not so deep<br /> As that its bed is dark, the shape returns<br /> So faint
      of our impictur'd lineaments,<br /> That on white forehead set a pearl as
      strong<br /> Comes to the eye: such saw I many a face,<br /> All stretch'd
      to speak, from whence I straight conceiv'd<br /> Delusion opposite to that,
      which rais'd<br /> Between the man and fountain, amorous flame.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden,
      as I perceiv'd them, deeming these<br /> Reflected semblances to see of
      whom<br /> They were, I turn'd mine eyes, and nothing saw;<br /> Then turn'd
      them back, directed on the light<br /> Of my sweet guide, who smiling shot
      forth beams<br /> From her celestial eyes. &nbsp;"Wonder not thou,"<br />
      She cry'd, "at this my smiling, when I see<br /> Thy childish judgment;
      since not yet on truth<br /> It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,<br />
      Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.<br /> True substances are these,
      which thou behold'st,<br /> Hither through failure of their vow exil'd.<br />
      But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,<br /> That the true light,

      to stray."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight to the shadow
      which for converse seem'd<br /> Most earnest, I addressed me, and began,<br />
      As one by over-eagerness perplex'd:<br /> "O spirit, born for joy! who in
      the rays<br /> Of life eternal, of that sweetness know'st<br /> The flavour,
      which, not tasted, passes far<br /> All apprehension, me it well would
      please,<br /> If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this<br /> Your
      station here." Whence she, with kindness prompt,<br /> And eyes glist'ning
      with smiles: "Our charity,<br /> To any wish by justice introduc'd,<br />
      Bars not the door, no more than she above,<br /> Who would have all her
      court be like herself.<br /> I was a virgin sister in the earth;<br /> And
      if thy mind observe me well, this form,<br /> With such addition grac'd of
      loveliness,<br /> Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt know<br />
      Piccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac'd,<br /> Here 'mid these other
      blessed also blest.<br /> Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone<br />
      With pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv'd,<br /> Admitted to his order
      dwell in joy.<br /> And this condition, which appears so low,<br /> Is for
      this cause assign'd us, that our vows<br /> Were in some part neglected and
      made void."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence I to her
      replied: "Something divine<br /> Beams in your countenance, wond'rous fair,<br />
      From former knowledge quite transmuting you.<br /> Therefore to recollect
      was I so slow.<br /> But what thou sayst hath to my memory<br /> Given now
      such aid, that to retrace your forms<br /> Is easier. &nbsp;Yet inform me,
      ye, who here<br /> Are happy, long ye for a higher place<br /> More to
      behold, and more in love to dwell?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
      with those other spirits gently smil'd,<br /> Then answer'd with such
      gladness, that she seem'd<br /> With love's first flame to glow: "Brother!
      our will<br /> Is in composure settled by the power<br /> Of charity, who
      makes us will alone<br /> What we possess, and nought beyond desire;<br />
      If we should wish to be exalted more,<br /> Then must our wishes jar with
      the high will<br /> Of him, who sets us here, which in these orbs<br /> Thou
      wilt confess not possible, if here<br /> To be in charity must needs
      befall,<br /> And if her nature well thou contemplate.<br /> Rather it is
      inherent in this state<br /> Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within<br />
      The divine will, by which our wills with his<br /> Are one. &nbsp;So that
      as we from step to step<br /> Are plac'd throughout this kingdom, pleases
      all,<br /> E'en as our King, who in us plants his will;<br /> And in his
      will is our tranquillity;<br /> It is the mighty ocean, whither tends<br />
      Whatever it creates and nature makes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
      saw I clearly how each spot in heav'n<br /> Is Paradise, though with like
      gracious dew<br /> The supreme virtue show'r not over all.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
      as it chances, if one sort of food<br /> Hath satiated, and of another
      still<br /> The appetite remains, that this is ask'd,<br /> And thanks for
      that return'd; e'en so did I<br /> In word and motion, bent from her to
      learn<br /> What web it was, through which she had not drawn<br /> The
      shuttle to its point. &nbsp;She thus began:<br /> "Exalted worth and
      perfectness of life<br /> The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,<br /> By
      whose pure laws upon your nether earth<br /> The robe and veil they wear,
      to that intent,<br /> That e'en till death they may keep watch or sleep<br />
      With their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,<br /> Which to his
      gracious pleasure love conforms.<br /> from the world, to follow her, when
      young<br /> Escap'd; and, in her vesture mantling me,<br /> Made promise of
      the way her sect enjoins.<br /> Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,<br />
      Forth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale.<br /> God knows how
      after that my life was fram'd.<br /> This other splendid shape, which thou
      beholdst<br /> At my right side, burning with all the light<br /> Of this
      our orb, what of myself I tell<br /> May to herself apply. &nbsp;From her,
      like me<br /> A sister, with like violence were torn<br /> The saintly
      folds, that shaded her fair brows.<br /> E'en when she to the world again
      was brought<br /> In spite of her own will and better wont,<br /> Yet not
      for that the bosom's inward veil<br /> Did she renounce. &nbsp;This is the
      luminary<br /> Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,<br /> Which
      blew the second over Suabia's realm,<br /> That power produc'd, which was
      the third and last."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ceas'd
      from further talk, and then began<br /> "Ave Maria" singing, and with that
      song<br /> Vanish'd, as heavy substance through deep wave.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine
      eye, that far as it was capable,<br /> Pursued her, when in dimness she was
      lost,<br /> Turn'd to the mark where greater want impell'd,<br /> And bent
      on Beatrice all its gaze.<br /> But she as light'ning beam'd upon my looks:<br />

      <br /> Between two kinds of food, both equally<br /> Remote and tempting,
      first a man might die<br /> Of hunger, ere he one could freely choose.<br />
      E'en so would stand a lamb between the maw<br /> Of two fierce wolves, in
      dread of both alike:<br /> E'en so between two deer a dog would stand,<br />
      Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise<br /> I to myself impute, by
      equal doubts<br /> Held in suspense, since of necessity<br /> It happen'd.
      &nbsp;Silent was I, yet desire<br /> Was painted in my looks; and thus I
      spake<br /> My wish more earnestly than language could.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
      Daniel, when the haughty king he freed<br /> From ire, that spurr'd him on
      to deeds unjust<br /> And violent; so look'd Beatrice then.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well
      I discern," she thus her words address'd,<br /> "How contrary desires each
      way constrain thee,<br /> So that thy anxious thought is in itself<br />
      Bound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth.<br /> Thou arguest; if the
      good intent remain;<br /> What reason that another's violence<br /> Should
      stint the measure of my fair desert?<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cause
      too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,<br /> That spirits to the
      stars, as Plato deem'd,<br /> Return. &nbsp;These are the questions which
      thy will<br /> Urge equally; and therefore I the first<br /> Of that will
      treat which hath the more of gall.<br /> Of seraphim he who is most
      ensky'd,<br /> Moses and Samuel, and either John,<br /> Choose which thou
      wilt, nor even Mary's self,<br /> Have not in any other heav'n their seats,<br />
      Than have those spirits which so late thou saw'st;<br /> Nor more or fewer
      years exist; but all<br /> Make the first circle beauteous, diversely<br />
      Partaking of sweet life, as more or less<br /> Afflation of eternal bliss
      pervades them.<br /> Here were they shown thee, not that fate assigns<br />
      This for their sphere, but for a sign to thee<br /> Of that celestial
      furthest from the height.<br /> Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we
      speak:<br /> Since from things sensible alone ye learn<br /> That, which
      digested rightly after turns<br /> To intellectual. &nbsp;For no other
      cause<br /> The scripture, condescending graciously<br /> To your
      perception, hands and feet to God<br /> Attributes, nor so means: and holy
      church<br /> Doth represent with human countenance<br /> Gabriel, and
      Michael, and him who made<br /> Tobias whole. &nbsp;Unlike what here thou
      seest,<br /> The judgment of Timaeus, who affirms<br /> Each soul restor'd
      to its particular star,<br /> Believing it to have been taken thence,<br />
      When nature gave it to inform her mold:<br /> Since to appearance his
      intention is<br /> E'en what his words declare: or else to shun<br />
      Derision, haply thus he hath disguis'd<br /> His true opinion. &nbsp;If his
      meaning be,<br /> That to the influencing of these orbs revert<br /> The
      honour and the blame in human acts,<br /> Perchance he doth not wholly miss
      the truth.<br /> This principle, not understood aright,<br /> Erewhile
      perverted well nigh all the world;<br /> So that it fell to fabled names of
      Jove,<br /> And Mercury, and Mars. &nbsp;That other doubt,<br /> Which moves
      thee, is less harmful; for it brings<br /> No peril of removing thee from
      me.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, to the eye of man, our
      justice seems<br /> Unjust, is argument for faith, and not<br /> For heretic
      declension. &nbsp;To the end<br /> This truth may stand more clearly in
      your view,<br /> I will content thee even to thy wish<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If
      violence be, when that which suffers, nought<br /> Consents to that which
      forceth, not for this<br /> These spirits stood exculpate. &nbsp;For the
      will,<br /> That will not, still survives unquench'd, and doth<br /> As
      nature doth in fire, tho' violence<br /> Wrest it a thousand times; for, if
      it yield<br /> Or more or less, so far it follows force.<br /> And thus did
      these, whom they had power to seek<br /> The hallow'd place again. &nbsp;In
      them, had will<br /> Been perfect, such as once upon the bars<br /> Held
      Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola<br /> To his own hand remorseless, to
      the path,<br /> Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten'd back,<br />
      When liberty return'd: but in too few<br /> Resolve so steadfast dwells.
      &nbsp;And by these words<br /> If duly weigh'd, that argument is void,<br />
      Which oft might have perplex'd thee still. &nbsp;But now<br /> Another
      question thwarts thee, which to solve<br /> Might try thy patience without
      better aid.<br /> I have, no doubt, instill'd into thy mind,<br /> That
      blessed spirit may not lie; since near<br /> The source of primal truth it
      dwells for aye:<br /> And thou might'st after of Piccarda learn<br /> That
      Constance held affection to the veil;<br /> So that she seems to contradict
      me here.<br /> Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc'd for men<br /> To do what
      they had gladly left undone,<br /> Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:<br />
      E'en as Alcmaeon, at his father's suit<br /> Slew his own mother, so made
      pitiless<br /> Not to lose pity. &nbsp;On this point bethink thee,<br />
      That force and will are blended in such wise<br /> As not to make the'
      offence excusable.<br /> Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,<br /> That
      inasmuch as there is fear of woe<br /> From non-compliance, it agrees.
      &nbsp;Of will<br /> Thus absolute Piccarda spake, and I<br /> Of th' other;
      so that both have truly said."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
      was the flow of that pure rill, that well'd<br /> From forth the fountain
      of all truth; and such<br /> The rest, that to my wond'ring thoughts I
      found.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O thou of primal
      love the prime delight!<br /> Goddess!" &nbsp;I straight reply'd, "whose
      lively words<br /> Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul!<br />
      Affection fails me to requite thy grace<br /> With equal sum of gratitude:
      be his<br /> To recompense, who sees and can reward thee.<br /> Well I
      discern, that by that truth alone<br /> Enlighten'd, beyond which no truth
      may roam,<br /> Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:<br /> Therein she
      resteth, e'en as in his lair<br /> The wild beast, soon as she hath reach'd
      that bound,<br /> And she hath power to reach it; else desire<br /> Were
      given to no end. &nbsp;And thence doth doubt<br /> Spring, like a shoot,
      around the stock of truth;<br /> And it is nature which from height to
      height<br /> On to the summit prompts us. &nbsp;This invites,<br /> This
      doth assure me, lady, rev'rently<br /> To ask thee of other truth, that yet<br />
      Is dark to me. &nbsp;I fain would know, if man<br /> By other works well
      done may so supply<br /> The failure of his vows, that in your scale<br />
      They lack not weight." &nbsp;I spake; and on me straight<br /> Beatrice
      look'd with eyes that shot forth sparks<br /> Of love celestial in such
      copious stream,<br /> That, virtue sinking in me overpower'd,<br /> I
      turn'd, and downward bent confus'd my sight. <br /><br /> <a name="link5"

      self-question to assure the soul."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus
      she her words, not heedless of my wish,<br /> Began; and thus, as one who
      breaks not off<br /> Discourse, continued in her saintly strain.<br />
      "Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave<br /> Of his free bounty, sign
      most evident<br /> Of goodness, and in his account most priz'd,<br /> Was
      liberty of will, the boon wherewith<br /> All intellectual creatures, and
      them sole<br /> He hath endow'd. &nbsp;Hence now thou mayst infer<br /> Of
      what high worth the vow, which so is fram'd<br /> That when man offers, God
      well-pleas'd accepts;<br /> For in the compact between God and him,<br />
      This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,<br /> He makes the victim,
      and of his own act.<br /> What compensation therefore may he find?<br /> If
      that, whereof thou hast oblation made,<br /> By using well thou think'st to
      consecrate,<br /> Thou would'st of theft do charitable deed.<br /> Thus I
      resolve thee of the greater point.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But
      forasmuch as holy church, herein<br /> Dispensing, seems to contradict the
      truth<br /> I have discover'd to thee, yet behooves<br /> Thou rest a little
      longer at the board,<br /> Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,<br />
      Digested fitly to nutrition turn.<br /> Open thy mind to what I now unfold,<br />
      And give it inward keeping. &nbsp;Knowledge comes<br /> Of learning well
      retain'd, unfruitful else.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This
      sacrifice in essence of two things<br /> Consisteth; one is that, whereof
      't is made,<br /> The covenant the other. &nbsp;For the last,<br /> It ne'er
      is cancell'd if not kept: and hence<br /> I spake erewhile so strictly of
      its force.<br /> For this it was enjoin'd the Israelites,<br /> Though leave
      were giv'n them, as thou know'st, to change<br /> The offering, still to
      offer. &nbsp;Th' other part,<br /> The matter and the substance of the vow,<br />
      May well be such, to that without offence<br /> It may for other substance
      be exchang'd.<br /> But at his own discretion none may shift<br /> The
      burden on his shoulders, unreleas'd<br /> By either key, the yellow and the
      white.<br /> Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,<br /> If the last
      bond be not within the new<br /> Included, as the quatre in the six.<br />
      No satisfaction therefore can be paid<br /> For what so precious in the
      balance weighs,<br /> That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.<br />
      Take then no vow at random: ta'en, with faith<br /> Preserve it; yet not
      bent, as Jephthah once,<br /> Blindly to execute a rash resolve,<br /> Whom
      better it had suited to exclaim,<br /> 'I have done ill,' than to redeem
      his pledge<br /> By doing worse or, not unlike to him<br /> In folly, that
      great leader of the Greeks:<br /> Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn'd<br />
      Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn<br /> Both wise and simple,
      even all, who hear<br /> Of so fell sacrifice. &nbsp;Be ye more staid,<br />
      O Christians, not, like feather, by each wind<br /> Removable: nor think to
      cleanse ourselves<br /> In every water. &nbsp;Either testament,<br /> The
      old and new, is yours: and for your guide<br /> The shepherd of the church
      let this suffice<br /> To save you. &nbsp;When by evil lust entic'd,<br />
      Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;<br /> Nor let the Jew, who
      dwelleth in your streets,<br /> Hold you in mock'ry. &nbsp;Be not, as the

      God's grace impell'd,<br /> I gave me wholly, and consign'd mine arms<br />
      To Belisarius, with whom heaven's right hand<br /> Was link'd in such
      conjointment, 't was a sign<br /> That I should rest. &nbsp;To thy first

      that its tendency doth prompt perforce<br /> To some addition; that thou

      Saw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fills<br /> The torrent Rhone.
      &nbsp;What after that it wrought,<br /> When from Ravenna it came forth,
      and leap'd<br /> The Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,<br /> That tongue nor
      pen may follow it. &nbsp;Tow'rds Spain<br /> It wheel'd its bands, then
      tow'rd Dyrrachium smote,<br /> And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge,<br />

      thence fell<br /> On Juba; and the next upon your west,<br /> At sound of
      the Pompeian trump, return'd.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What
      following and in its next bearer's gripe<br /> It wrought, is now by
      Cassius and Brutus<br /> Bark'd off in hell, and by Perugia's sons<br /> And
      Modena's was mourn'd. &nbsp;Hence weepeth still<br /> Sad Cleopatra, who,

      living Justice, in whose breath I move,<br /> Committed glory, e'en into
      his hands,<br /> To execute the vengeance of its wrath.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hear
      now and wonder at what next I tell.<br /> After with Titus it was sent to
      wreak<br /> Vengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin,<br /> And, when the
      Lombard tooth, with fangs impure,<br /> Did gore the bosom of the holy
      church,<br /> Under its wings victorious, Charlemagne<br /> Sped to her
      rescue. &nbsp;Judge then for thyself<br /> Of those, whom I erewhile
      accus'd to thee,<br /> What they are, and how grievous their offending,<br />
      Who are the cause of all your ills. &nbsp;The one<br /> Against the
      universal ensign rears<br /> The yellow lilies, and with partial aim<br />
      That to himself the other arrogates:<br /> So that 't is hard to see which
      more offends.<br /> Be yours, ye Ghibellines, to veil your arts<br />
      Beneath another standard: ill is this<br /> Follow'd of him, who severs it
      and justice:<br /> And let not with his Guelphs the new-crown'd Charles<br />

      lofty port<br /> Have rent the easing. &nbsp;Many a time ere now<br /> The

      good spirits,<br /> Whose mortal lives were busied to that end,<br /> That
      honour and renown might wait on them:<br /> And, when desires thus err in
      their intention,<br /> True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.<br />
      But it is part of our delight, to measure<br /> Our wages with the merit;

      thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:<br /> "If I have power to show one

      Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail.<br /> Wilt thou this truth
      more clearly evidenc'd?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom I
      thus: "It is enough: no fear,<br /> I see, lest nature in her part should
      tire."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straight rejoin'd: "Say,
      were it worse for man,<br /> If he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?"<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea," answer'd I; "nor here a reason
      needs."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And may that be, if
      different estates<br /> Grow not of different duties in your life?<br />
      Consult your teacher, and he tells you 'no."'<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus
      did he come, deducing to this point,<br /> And then concluded: "For this
      cause behooves,<br /> The roots, from whence your operations come,<br />
      Must differ. &nbsp;Therefore one is Solon born;<br /> Another, Xerxes; and
      Melchisidec<br /> A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage<br /> Cost him
      his son. &nbsp;In her circuitous course,<br /> Nature, that is the seal to
      mortal wax,<br /> Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns<br /> 'Twixt
      one or other household. &nbsp;Hence befalls<br /> That Esau is so wide of
      Jacob: hence<br /> Quirinus of so base a father springs,<br /> He dates from
      Mars his lineage. &nbsp;Were it not<br /> That providence celestial
      overrul'd,<br /> Nature, in generation, must the path<br /> Trac'd by the
      generator, still pursue<br /> Unswervingly. &nbsp;Thus place I in thy sight<br />
      That, which was late behind thee. &nbsp;But, in sign<br /> Of more
      affection for thee, 't is my will<br /> Thou wear this corollary. &nbsp;Nature
      ever<br /> Finding discordant fortune, like all seed<br /> Out of its proper

      And work on the foundation nature lays,<br /> It would not lack supply of
      excellence.<br /> But ye perversely to religion strain<br /> Him, who was
      born to gird on him the sword,<br /> And of the fluent phrasemen make your

      <br /> After solution of my doubt, thy Charles,<br /> O fair Clemenza, of
      the treachery spake<br /> That must befall his seed: but, "Tell it not,"<br />
      Said he, "and let the destin'd years come round."<br /> Nor may I tell thee
      more, save that the meed<br /> Of sorrow well-deserv'd shall quit your
      wrongs.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the visage of that
      saintly light<br /> Was to the sun, that fills it, turn'd again,<br /> As to
      the good, whose plenitude of bliss<br /> Sufficeth all. &nbsp;O ye
      misguided souls!<br /> Infatuate, who from such a good estrange<br /> Your
      hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,<br /> Alas for you!&mdash;And lo!
      toward me, next,<br /> Another of those splendent forms approach'd,<br />
      That, by its outward bright'ning, testified<br /> The will it had to
      pleasure me. &nbsp;The eyes<br /> Of Beatrice, resting, as before,<br />
      Firmly upon me, manifested forth<br /> Approval of my wish. &nbsp;"And O,"
      I cried,<br /> "Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform'd;<br /> And prove
      thou to me, that my inmost thoughts<br /> I can reflect on thee." &nbsp;Thereat
      the light,<br /> That yet was new to me, from the recess,<br /> Where it
      before was singing, thus began,<br /> As one who joys in kindness: "In that
      part<br /> Of the deprav'd Italian land, which lies<br /> Between Rialto,
      and the fountain-springs<br /> Of Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,<br />
      But to no lofty eminence, a hill,<br /> From whence erewhile a firebrand
      did descend,<br /> That sorely sheet the region. &nbsp;From one root<br /> I
      and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:<br /> And here I glitter, for that
      by its light<br /> This star o'ercame me. &nbsp;Yet I naught repine,<br />
      Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,<br /> Which haply vulgar hearts
      can scarce conceive.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This jewel,
      that is next me in our heaven,<br /> Lustrous and costly, great renown hath
      left,<br /> And not to perish, ere these hundred years<br /> Five times
      absolve their round. &nbsp;Consider thou,<br /> If to excel be worthy man's
      endeavour,<br /> When such life may attend the first. &nbsp;Yet they<br />
      Care not for this, the crowd that now are girt<br /> By Adice and
      Tagliamento, still<br /> Impenitent, tho' scourg'd. &nbsp;The hour is near,<br />
      When for their stubbornness at Padua's marsh<br /> The water shall be
      chang'd, that laves Vicena<br /> And where Cagnano meets with Sile, one<br />
      Lords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom<br /> The web is now
      a-warping. &nbsp;Feltro too<br /> Shall sorrow for its godless shepherd's
      fault,<br /> Of so deep stain, that never, for the like,<br /> Was Malta's
      bar unclos'd. &nbsp;Too large should be<br /> The skillet, that would hold
      Ferrara's blood,<br /> And wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,<br />
      The which this priest, in show of party-zeal,<br /> Courteous will give;
      nor will the gift ill suit<br /> The country's custom. &nbsp;We descry
      above,<br /> Mirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to us<br /> Reflected
      shine the judgments of our God:<br /> Whence these our sayings we avouch
      for good."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ended, and appear'd
      on other thoughts<br /> Intent, re-ent'ring on the wheel she late<br /> Had
      left. &nbsp;That other joyance meanwhile wax'd<br /> A thing to marvel at,
      in splendour glowing,<br /> Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,<br />
      For, in that upper clime, effulgence comes<br /> Of gladness, as here
      laughter: and below,<br /> As the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade.<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God seeth all: and in him is thy
      sight,"<br /> Said I, "blest Spirit! &nbsp;Therefore will of his<br />
      Cannot to thee be dark. &nbsp;Why then delays<br /> Thy voice to satisfy my
      wish untold,<br /> That voice which joins the inexpressive song,<br />
      Pastime of heav'n, the which those ardours sing,<br /> That cowl them with
      six shadowing wings outspread?<br /> I would not wait thy asking, wert thou
      known<br /> To me, as thoroughly I to thee am known."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
      forthwith answ'ring, thus his words began:<br /> "The valley' of waters,
      widest next to that<br /> Which doth the earth engarland, shapes its
      course,<br /> Between discordant shores, against the sun<br /> Inward so
      far, it makes meridian there,<br /> Where was before th' horizon. &nbsp;Of
      that vale<br /> Dwelt I upon the shore, 'twixt Ebro's stream<br /> And
      Macra's, that divides with passage brief<br /> Genoan bounds from Tuscan.
      &nbsp;East and west<br /> Are nearly one to Begga and my land,<br /> Whose
      haven erst was with its own blood warm.<br /> Who knew my name were wont to
      call me Folco:<br /> And I did bear impression of this heav'n,<br /> That
      now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame<br /> Glow'd Belus' daughter,
      injuring alike<br /> Sichaeus and Creusa, than did I,<br /> Long as it
      suited the unripen'd down<br /> That fledg'd my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,<br />
      That was beguiled of Demophoon;<br /> Nor Jove's son, when the charms of
      Iole<br /> Were shrin'd within his heart. &nbsp;And yet there hides<br /> No
      sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,<br /> Not for the fault (that doth
      not come to mind),<br /> But for the virtue, whose o'erruling sway<br /> And
      providence have wrought thus quaintly. &nbsp;Here<br /> The skill is look'd
      into, that fashioneth<br /> With such effectual working, and the good<br />
      Discern'd, accruing to this upper world<br /> From that below. &nbsp;But

      Demands my further parle. &nbsp;Inquire thou wouldst,<br /> Who of this
      light is denizen, that here<br /> Beside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth<br />
      On the clear wave. &nbsp;Know then, the soul of Rahab<br /> Is in that
      gladsome harbour, to our tribe<br /> United, and the foremost rank
      assign'd.<br /> He to that heav'n, at which the shadow ends<br /> Of your
      sublunar world, was taken up,<br /> First, in Christ's triumph, of all
      souls redeem'd:<br /> For well behoov'd, that, in some part of heav'n,<br />
      She should remain a trophy, to declare<br /> The mighty contest won with
      either palm;<br /> For that she favour'd first the high exploit<br /> Of
      Joshua on the holy land, whereof<br /> The Pope recks little now. &nbsp;Thy

      abjectness of heart<br /> Weigh down his eyelids, for that he was son<br />
      Of Pietro Bernardone, and by men<br /> In wond'rous sort despis'd. &nbsp;But
      royally<br /> His hard intention he to Innocent<br /> Set forth, and from
      him first receiv'd the seal<br /> On his religion. &nbsp;Then, when

      through thirst of martyrdom, stood up<br /> In the proud Soldan's presence,
      and there preach'd<br /> Christ and his followers; but found the race<br />
      Unripen'd for conversion: back once more<br /> He hasted (not to intermit
      his toil),<br /> And reap'd Ausonian lands. &nbsp;On the hard rock,<br />
      'Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ<br /> Took the last Signet, which
      his limbs two years<br /> Did carry. &nbsp;Then the season come, that he,<br />
      Who to such good had destin'd him, was pleas'd<br /> T' advance him to the
      meed, which he had earn'd<br /> By his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,<br />
      As their just heritage, he gave in charge<br /> His dearest lady, and
      enjoin'd their love<br /> And faith to her: and, from her bosom, will'd<br />
      His goodly spirit should move forth, returning<br /> To its appointed

      <br /> True love, that ever shows itself as clear<br /> In kindness, as
      loose appetite in wrong,<br /> Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still'd<br />
      The sacred chords, that are by heav'n's right hand<br /> Unwound and
      tighten'd, flow to righteous prayers<br /> Should they not hearken, who, to
      give me will<br /> For praying, in accordance thus were mute?<br /> He hath
      in sooth good cause for endless grief,<br /> Who, for the love of thing
      that lasteth not,<br /> Despoils himself forever of that love.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
      oft along the still and pure serene,<br /> At nightfall, glides a sudden
      trail of fire,<br /> Attracting with involuntary heed<br /> The eye to
      follow it, erewhile at rest,<br /> And seems some star that shifted place
      in heav'n,<br /> Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost,<br /> And it is
      soon extinct; thus from the horn,<br /> That on the dexter of the cross
      extends,<br /> Down to its foot, one luminary ran<br /> From mid the cluster
      shone there; yet no gem<br /> Dropp'd from its foil; and through the beamy
      list<br /> Like flame in alabaster, glow'd its course.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
      forward stretch'd him (if of credence aught<br /> Our greater muse may
      claim) the pious ghost<br /> Of old Anchises, in the' Elysian bower,<br />
      When he perceiv'd his son. &nbsp;"O thou, my blood!<br /> O most exceeding
      grace divine! to whom,<br /> As now to thee, hath twice the heav'nly gate<br />
      Been e'er unclos'd?" so spake the light; whence I<br /> Turn'd me toward
      him; then unto my dame<br /> My sight directed, and on either side<br />
      Amazement waited me; for in her eyes<br /> Was lighted such a smile, I
      thought that mine<br /> Had div'd unto the bottom of my grace<br /> And of
      my bliss in Paradise. &nbsp;Forthwith<br /> To hearing and to sight
      grateful alike,<br /> The spirit to his proem added things<br /> I
      understood not, so profound he spake;<br /> Yet not of choice but through
      necessity<br /> Mysterious; for his high conception scar'd<br /> Beyond the
      mark of mortals. &nbsp;When the flight<br /> Of holy transport had so spent
      its rage,<br /> That nearer to the level of our thought<br /> The speech
      descended, the first sounds I heard<br /> Were, "Best he thou, Triunal
      Deity!<br /> That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf'd!"<br /> Then
      follow'd: "No unpleasant thirst, tho' long,<br /> Which took me reading in
      the sacred book,<br /> Whose leaves or white or dusky never change,<br />
      Thou hast allay'd, my son, within this light,<br /> From whence my voice
      thou hear'st; more thanks to her.<br /> Who for such lofty mounting has
      with plumes<br /> Begirt thee. &nbsp;Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me<br />
      From him transmitted, who is first of all,<br /> E'en as all numbers ray
      from unity;<br /> And therefore dost not ask me who I am,<br /> Or why to
      thee more joyous I appear,<br /> Than any other in this gladsome throng.<br />
      The truth is as thou deem'st; for in this hue<br /> Both less and greater
      in that mirror look,<br /> In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think'st, are
      shown.<br /> But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,<br /> Urging
      with sacred thirst of sweet desire,<br /> May be contended fully, let thy
      voice,<br /> Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth<br /> Thy will
      distinctly, utter forth the wish,<br /> Whereto my ready answer stands
      decreed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn'd me to Beatrice;
      and she heard<br /> Ere I had spoken, smiling, an assent,<br /> That to my
      will gave wings; and I began<br /> "To each among your tribe, what time ye
      kenn'd<br /> The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,<br /> Wisdom and
      love were in one measure dealt;<br /> For that they are so equal in the
      sun,<br /> From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,<br /> As makes
      all likeness scant. &nbsp;But will and means,<br /> In mortals, for the
      cause ye well discern,<br /> With unlike wings are fledge. &nbsp;A mortal I<br />
      Experience inequality like this,<br /> And therefore give no thanks, but in
      the heart,<br /> For thy paternal greeting. &nbsp;This howe'er<br /> I pray
      thee, living topaz! that ingemm'st<br /> This precious jewel, let me hear
      thy name."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am thy root, O leaf!
      whom to expect<br /> Even, hath pleas'd me:" &nbsp;thus the prompt reply<br />
      Prefacing, next it added: "he, of whom<br /> Thy kindred appellation comes,
      and who,<br /> These hundred years and more, on its first ledge<br /> Hath
      circuited the mountain, was my son<br /> And thy great grandsire. &nbsp;Well
      befits, his long<br /> Endurance should be shorten'd by thy deeds.<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Florence, within her ancient
      limit-mark,<br /> Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon,<br /> Was

      More than the person did. &nbsp;Time was not yet,<br /> When at his
      daughter's birth the sire grew pale.<br /> For fear the age and dowry
      should exceed<br /> On each side just proportion. &nbsp;House was none<br />
      Void of its family; nor yet had come<br /> Hardanapalus, to exhibit feats<br />
      Of chamber prowess. &nbsp;Montemalo yet<br /> O'er our suburban turret
      rose; as much<br /> To be surpass in fall, as in its rising.<br /> I saw
      Bellincione Berti walk abroad<br /> In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;<br />

      With unrob'd jerkin; and their good dames handling<br /> The spindle and
      the flax; O happy they!<br /> Each sure of burial in her native land,<br />
      And none left desolate a-bed for France!<br /> One wak'd to tend the
      cradle, hushing it<br /> With sounds that lull'd the parent's infancy:<br />
      Another, with her maidens, drawing off<br /> The tresses from the distaff,
      lectur'd them<br /> Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.<br /> A
      Salterello and Cianghella we<br /> Had held as strange a marvel, as ye
      would<br /> A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In
      such compos'd and seemly fellowship,<br /> Such faithful and such fair

      with voice more sweet,<br /> Yet not in this our modern phrase, forthwith<br />
      It answer'd: "From the day, when it was said<br /> 'Hail Virgin!' to the
      throes, by which my mother,<br /> Who now is sainted, lighten'd her of me<br />
      Whom she was heavy with, this fire had come,<br /> Five hundred fifty times

      birth-place, where the last<br /> Partition of our city first is reach'd<br />
      By him, that runs her annual game. &nbsp;Thus much<br /> Suffice of my
      forefathers: who they were,<br /> And whence they hither came, more
      honourable<br /> It is to pass in silence than to tell.<br /> All those, who
      in that time were there from Mars<br /> Until the Baptist, fit to carry

      much better were it, that these people<br /> Were neighbours to you, and
      that at Galluzzo<br /> And at Trespiano, ye should have your bound'ry,<br />
      Than to have them within, and bear the stench<br /> Of Aguglione's hind,
      and Signa's, him,<br /> That hath his eye already keen for bart'ring!<br />

      been turn'd adrift<br /> To Simifonte, where his grandsire ply'd<br /> The

      Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.<br /> The city's malady hath ever source<br />
      In the confusion of its persons, as<br /> The body's, in variety of food:<br />
      And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,<br /> Than the blind lamb;
      and oftentimes one sword<br /> Doth more and better execution,<br /> Than

      speedily sink the bark,<br /> The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung<br /> The
      County Guido, and whoso hath since<br /> His title from the fam'd
      Bellincione ta'en.<br /> Fair governance was yet an art well priz'd<br /> By
      him of Pressa: Galigaio show'd<br /> The gilded hilt and pommel, in his
      house.<br /> The column, cloth'd with verrey, still was seen<br /> Unshaken:
      the Sacchetti still were great,<br /> Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,<br />
      With them who blush to hear the bushel nam'd.<br /> Of the Calfucci still
      the branchy trunk<br /> Was in its strength: and to the curule chairs<br />

      sires of those, who now,<br /> As surely as your church is vacant, flock<br />
      Into her consistory, and at leisure<br /> There stall them and grow fat.
      &nbsp;The o'erweening brood,<br /> That plays the dragon after him that
      flees,<br /> But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,<br /> Ay or the

      lore, replied<br /> The spirit of paternal love, enshrin'd,<br /> Yet in his
      smile apparent; and thus spake:<br /> "Contingency, unfolded not to view<br />
      Upon the tablet of your mortal mold,<br /> Is all depictur'd in the'
      eternal sight;<br /> But hence deriveth not necessity,<br /> More then the
      tall ship, hurried down the flood,<br /> Doth from the vision, that
      reflects the scene.<br /> From thence, as to the ear sweet harmony<br />
      From organ comes, so comes before mine eye<br /> The time prepar'd for
      thee. &nbsp;Such as driv'n out<br /> From Athens, by his cruel stepdame's
      wiles,<br /> Hippolytus departed, such must thou<br /> Depart from Florence.
      &nbsp;This they wish, and this<br /> Contrive, and will ere long
      effectuate, there,<br /> Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,<br />
      Throughout the livelong day. &nbsp;The common cry,<br /> Will, as 't is
      ever wont, affix the blame<br /> Unto the party injur'd: but the truth<br />
      Shall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find<br /> A faithful witness.
      &nbsp;Thou shall leave each thing<br /> Belov'd most dearly: this is the
      first shaft<br /> Shot from the bow of exile. &nbsp;Thou shalt prove<br />
      How salt the savour is of other's bread,<br /> How hard the passage to
      descend and climb<br /> By other's stairs, But that shall gall thee most<br />
      Will be the worthless and vile company,<br /> With whom thou must be thrown
      into these straits.<br /> For all ungrateful, impious all and mad,<br />
      Shall turn 'gainst thee: but in a little while<br /> Theirs and not thine
      shall be the crimson'd brow<br /> Their course shall so evince their
      brutishness<br /> T' have ta'en thy stand apart shall well become thee.<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First refuge thou must find, first
      place of rest,<br /> In the great Lombard's courtesy, who bears<br /> Upon
      the ladder perch'd the sacred bird.<br /> He shall behold thee with such
      kind regard,<br /> That 'twixt ye two, the contrary to that<br /> Which
      falls 'twixt other men, the granting shall<br /> Forerun the asking. &nbsp;With
      him shalt thou see<br /> That mortal, who was at his birth impress<br /> So
      strongly from this star, that of his deeds<br /> The nations shall take
      note. &nbsp;His unripe age<br /> Yet holds him from observance; for these
      wheels<br /> Only nine years have compass him about.<br /> But, ere the
      Gascon practice on great Harry,<br /> Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth
      in him,<br /> In equal scorn of labours and of gold.<br /> His bounty shall
      be spread abroad so widely,<br /> As not to let the tongues e'en of his
      foes<br /> Be idle in its praise. &nbsp;Look thou to him<br /> And his
      beneficence: for he shall cause<br /> Reversal of their lot to many people,<br />
      Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.<br /> And thou shalt bear this
      written in thy soul<br /> Of him, but tell it not;" and things he told<br />
      Incredible to those who witness them;<br /> Then added: "So interpret thou,
      my son,<br /> What hath been told thee.&mdash;Lo! the ambushment<br /> That
      a few circling seasons hide for thee!<br /> Yet envy not thy neighbours:
      time extends<br /> Thy span beyond their treason's chastisement."<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, as the saintly spirit, by his
      silence,<br /> Had shown the web, which I had streteh'd for him<br /> Upon
      the warp, was woven, I began,<br /> As one, who in perplexity desires<br />
      Counsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:<br /> "My father! well I mark
      how time spurs on<br /> Toward me, ready to inflict the blow,<br /> Which
      falls most heavily on him, who most<br /> Abandoned himself. &nbsp;Therefore
      't is good<br /> I should forecast, that driven from the place<br /> Most
      dear to me, I may not lose myself<br /> All others by my song. &nbsp;Down
      through the world<br /> Of infinite mourning, and along the mount<br /> From
      whose fair height my lady's eyes did lift me,<br /> And after through this
      heav'n from light to light,<br /> Have I learnt that, which if I tell
      again,<br /> It may with many woefully disrelish;<br /> And, if I am a timid
      friend to truth,<br /> I fear my life may perish among those,<br /> To whom
      these days shall be of ancient date."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      brightness, where enclos'd the treasure smil'd,<br /> Which I had found
      there, first shone glisteningly,<br /> Like to a golden mirror in the sun;<br />
      Next answer'd: "Conscience, dimm'd or by its own<br /> Or other's shame,
      will feel thy saying sharp.<br /> Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit
      remov'd,<br /> See the whole vision be made manifest.<br /> And let them
      wince who have their withers wrung.<br /> What though, when tasted first,
      thy voice shall prove<br /> Unwelcome, on digestion it will turn<br /> To
      vital nourishment. &nbsp;The cry thou raisest,<br /> Shall, as the wind
      doth, smite the proudest summits;<br /> Which is of honour no light
      argument,<br /> For this there only have been shown to thee,<br />
      Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,<br /> Spirits, whom fame
      hath note of. &nbsp;For the mind<br /> Of him, who hears, is loth to
      acquiesce<br /> And fix its faith, unless the instance brought<br /> Be
      palpable, and proof apparent urge." <br /><br /> <a name="link18" id="link18"></a>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> CANTO XVIII Now in his word, sole, ruminating, joy'd<br /> That
      blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,<br /> Tempting the sweet with bitter:
      she meanwhile,<br /> Who led me unto God, admonish'd: "Muse<br /> On other
      thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him<br /> I dwell, who recompenseth every
      wrong."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sweet sounds of
      comfort straight I turn'd;<br /> And, in the saintly eyes what love was
      seen,<br /> I leave in silence here: nor through distrust<br /> Of my words
      only, but that to such bliss<br /> The mind remounts not without aid.
      &nbsp;Thus much<br /> Yet may I speak; that, as I gaz'd on her,<br />
      Affection found no room for other wish.<br /> While the everlasting
      pleasure, that did full<br /> On Beatrice shine, with second view<br /> From
      her fair countenance my gladden'd soul<br /> Contented; vanquishing me with
      a beam<br /> Of her soft smile, she spake: "Turn thee, and list.<br /> These
      eyes are not thy only Paradise."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
      here we sometimes in the looks may see<br /> Th' affection mark'd, when
      that its sway hath ta'en<br /> The spirit wholly; thus the hallow'd light,<br />
      To whom I turn'd, flashing, bewray'd its will<br /> To talk yet further
      with me, and began:<br /> "On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life<br />
      Is from its top, whose fruit is ever fair<br /> And leaf unwith'ring,
      blessed spirits abide,<br /> That were below, ere they arriv'd in heav'n,<br />
      So mighty in renown, as every muse<br /> Might grace her triumph with them.
      &nbsp;On the horns<br /> Look therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,<br />
      Shall there enact, as doth in summer cloud<br /> Its nimble fire." &nbsp;Along
      the cross I saw,<br /> At the repeated name of Joshua,<br /> A splendour
      gliding; nor, the word was said,<br /> Ere it was done: then, at the naming
      saw<br /> Of the great Maccabee, another move<br /> With whirling speed; and
      gladness was the scourge<br /> Unto that top. &nbsp;The next for
      Charlemagne<br /> And for the peer Orlando, two my gaze<br /> Pursued,
      intently, as the eye pursues<br /> A falcon flying. &nbsp;Last, along the
      cross,<br /> William, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew<br /> My ken, and
      Robert Guiscard. &nbsp;And the soul,<br /> Who spake with me among the
      other lights<br /> Did move away, and mix; and with the choir<br /> Of
      heav'nly songsters prov'd his tuneful skill.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
      Beatrice on my right l bent,<br /> Looking for intimation or by word<br />
      Or act, what next behoov'd: and did descry<br /> Such mere effulgence in
      her eyes, such joy,<br /> It past all former wont. &nbsp;And, as by sense<br />
      Of new delight, the man, who perseveres<br /> In good deeds doth perceive
      from day to day<br /> His virtue growing; I e'en thus perceiv'd<br /> Of my
      ascent, together with the heav'n<br /> The circuit widen'd, noting the
      increase<br /> Of beauty in that wonder. &nbsp;Like the change<br /> In a
      brief moment on some maiden's cheek,<br /> Which from its fairness doth
      discharge the weight<br /> Of pudency, that stain'd it; such in her,<br />
      And to mine eyes so sudden was the change,<br /> Through silvery whiteness
      of that temperate star,<br /> Whose sixth orb now enfolded us. &nbsp;I saw,<br />
      Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks<br /> Of love, that reign'd
      there, fashion to my view<br /> Our language. &nbsp;And as birds, from
      river banks<br /> Arisen, now in round, now lengthen'd troop,<br /> Array
      them in their flight, greeting, as seems,<br /> Their new-found pastures;
      so, within the lights,<br /> The saintly creatures flying, sang, and made<br />

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> First, singing, to their notes they mov'd, then one<br />
      Becoming of these signs, a little while<br /> Did rest them, and were mute.
      &nbsp;O nymph divine<br /> Of Pegasean race! whose souls, which thou<br />

      by thee! thou with thyself<br /> Inform me; that I may set forth the
      shapes,<br /> As fancy doth present them. &nbsp;Be thy power<br /> Display'd

      five-fold seven.<br /> In order each, as they appear'd, I mark'd.<br />
      Diligite Justitiam, the first,<br /> Both verb and noun all blazon'd; and

      with gold.<br /> And on the summit of the M. I saw<br /> Descending other
      lights, that rested there,<br /> Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal
      good.<br /> Then, as at shaking of a lighted brand,<br /> Sparkles
      innumerable on all sides<br /> Rise scatter'd, source of augury to th'
      unwise;<br /> Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence<br /> Seem'd
      reascending, and a higher pitch<br /> Some mounting, and some less; e'en as
      the sun,<br /> Which kindleth them, decreed. &nbsp;And when each one<br />
      Had settled in his place, the head and neck<br /> Then saw I of an eagle,
      lively<br /> Grav'd in that streaky fire. &nbsp;Who painteth there,<br />
      Hath none to guide him; of himself he guides;<br /> And every line and
      texture of the nest<br /> Doth own from him the virtue, fashions it.<br />

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> Before my sight appear'd, with open wings,<br /> The
      beauteous image, in fruition sweet<br /> Gladdening the thronged spirits.
      &nbsp;Each did seem<br /> A little ruby, whereon so intense<br /> The
      sun-beam glow'd that to mine eyes it came<br /> In clear refraction. &nbsp;And
      that, which next<br /> Befalls me to portray, voice hath not utter'd,<br />
      Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasy<br /> Was e'er conceiv'd. &nbsp;For I
      beheld and heard<br /> The beak discourse; and, what intention form'd<br />
      Of many, singly as of one express,<br /> Beginning: "For that I was just
      and piteous,<br /> l am exalted to this height of glory,<br /> The which no
      wish exceeds: and there on earth<br /> Have I my memory left, e'en by the
      bad<br /> Commended, while they leave its course untrod."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus
      is one heat from many embers felt,<br /> As in that image many were the
      loves,<br /> And one the voice, that issued from them all.<br /> Whence I
      address them: "O perennial flowers<br /> Of gladness everlasting! that
      exhale<br /> In single breath your odours manifold!<br /> Breathe now; and
      let the hunger be appeas'd,<br /> That with great craving long hath held my
      soul,<br /> Finding no food on earth. &nbsp;This well I know,<br /> That if
      there be in heav'n a realm, that shows<br /> In faithful mirror the
      celestial Justice,<br /> Yours without veil reflects it. &nbsp;Ye discern<br />
      The heed, wherewith I do prepare myself<br /> To hearken; ye the doubt that
      urges me<br /> With such inveterate craving." &nbsp;Straight I saw,<br />
      Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,<br /> That rears his head, and
      claps him with his wings,<br /> His beauty and his eagerness bewraying.<br />
      So saw I move that stately sign, with praise<br /> Of grace divine inwoven
      and high song<br /> Of inexpressive joy. &nbsp;"He," it began,<br /> "Who
      turn'd his compass on the world's extreme,<br /> And in that space so
      variously hath wrought,<br /> Both openly, and in secret, in such wise<br />
      Could not through all the universe display<br /> Impression of his glory,
      that the Word<br /> Of his omniscience should not still remain<br /> In
      infinite excess. &nbsp;In proof whereof,<br /> He first through pride
      supplanted, who was sum<br /> Of each created being, waited not<br /> For
      light celestial, and abortive fell.<br /> Whence needs each lesser nature
      is but scant<br /> Receptacle unto that Good, which knows<br /> No limit,
      measur'd by itself alone.<br /> Therefore your sight, of th' omnipresent
      Mind<br /> A single beam, its origin must own<br /> Surpassing far its
      utmost potency.<br /> The ken, your world is gifted with, descends<br /> In
      th' everlasting Justice as low down,<br /> As eye doth in the sea; which
      though it mark<br /> The bottom from the shore, in the wide main<br />
      Discerns it not; and ne'ertheless it is,<br /> But hidden through its
      deepness. &nbsp;Light is none,<br /> Save that which cometh from the pure
      serene<br /> Of ne'er disturbed ether: for the rest,<br /> 'Tis darkness
      all, or shadow of the flesh,<br /> Or else its poison. &nbsp;Here confess
      reveal'd<br /> That covert, which hath hidden from thy search<br /> The
      living justice, of the which thou mad'st<br /> Such frequent question; for
      thou saidst&mdash;'A man<br /> Is born on Indus' banks, and none is there<br />

      And he offendeth not in word or deed.<br /> But unbaptiz'd he dies, and
      void of faith.<br /> Where is the justice that condemns him? &nbsp;where<br />
      His blame, if he believeth not?'&mdash;What then,<br /> And who art thou,
      that on the stool wouldst sit<br /> To judge at distance of a thousand
      miles<br /> With the short-sighted vision of a span?<br /> To him, who
      subtilizes thus with me,<br /> There would assuredly be room for doubt<br />
      Even to wonder, did not the safe word<br /> Of scripture hold supreme
      authority.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O animals of clay!
      &nbsp;O spirits gross I<br /> The primal will, that in itself is good,<br />
      Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne'er been mov'd.<br /> Justice consists
      in consonance with it,<br /> Derivable by no created good,<br /> Whose very

      on her nest the stork, that turns about<br /> Unto her young, whom lately

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet love! that
      dost apparel thee in smiles,<br /> How lustrous was thy semblance in those
      sparkles,<br /> Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir'd!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
      the precious and bright beaming stones,<br /> That did ingem the sixth
      light, ceas'd the chiming<br /> Of their angelic bells; methought I heard<br />
      The murmuring of a river, that doth fall<br /> From rock to rock
      transpicuous, making known<br /> The richness of his spring-head: and as
      sound<br /> Of cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,<br /> Is, at the
      wind-hole, modulate and tun'd;<br /> Thus up the neck, as it were hollow,
      rose<br /> That murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith<br /> Voice there
      assum'd, and thence along the beak<br /> Issued in form of words, such as
      my heart<br /> Did look for, on whose tables I inscrib'd them.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The
      part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,<br /> In mortal eagles," it
      began, "must now<br /> Be noted steadfastly: for of the fires,<br /> That
      figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,<br /> Are chief of all the
      greatest. &nbsp;This, that shines<br /> Midmost for pupil, was the same,
      who sang<br /> The Holy Spirit's song, and bare about<br /> The ark from
      town to town; now doth he know<br /> The merit of his soul-impassion'd
      strains<br /> By their well-fitted guerdon. &nbsp;Of the five,<br /> That
      make the circle of the vision, he<br /> Who to the beak is nearest,
      comforted<br /> The widow for her son: now doth he know<br /> How dear he
      costeth not to follow Christ,<br /> Both from experience of this pleasant
      life,<br /> And of its opposite. &nbsp;He next, who follows<br /> In the
      circumference, for the over arch,<br /> By true repenting slack'd the pace
      of death:<br /> Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav'n<br /> Alter not,
      when through pious prayer below<br /> Today's is made tomorrow's destiny.<br />
      The other following, with the laws and me,<br /> To yield the shepherd
      room, pass'd o'er to Greece,<br /> From good intent producing evil fruit:<br />
      Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv'd<br /> From his well doing, doth
      not helm him aught,<br /> Though it have brought destruction on the world.<br />
      That, which thou seest in the under bow,<br /> Was William, whom that land
      bewails, which weeps<br /> For Charles and Frederick living: now he knows<br />
      How well is lov'd in heav'n the righteous king,<br /> Which he betokens by
      his radiant seeming.<br /> Who in the erring world beneath would deem,<br />
      That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set<br /> Fifth of the saintly
      splendours? &nbsp;now he knows<br /> Enough of that, which the world cannot
      see,<br /> The grace divine, albeit e'en his sight<br /> Reach not its
      utmost depth." &nbsp;Like to the lark,<br /> That warbling in the air
      expatiates long,<br /> Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,<br /> Drops
      satiate with the sweetness; such appear'd<br /> That image stampt by the'
      everlasting pleasure,<br /> Which fashions like itself all lovely things.<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, though my doubting were as manifest,<br />
      As is through glass the hue that mantles it,<br /> In silence waited not:
      for to my lips<br /> "What things are these?" &nbsp;involuntary rush'd,<br />
      And forc'd a passage out: whereat I mark'd<br /> A sudden lightening and
      new revelry.<br /> The eye was kindled: and the blessed sign<br /> No more
      to keep me wond'ring and suspense,<br /> Replied: "I see that thou
      believ'st these things,<br /> Because I tell them, but discern'st not how;<br />
      So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:<br /> As one who knows the
      name of thing by rote,<br /> But is a stranger to its properties,<br /> Till
      other's tongue reveal them. &nbsp;Fervent love<br /> And lively hope with
      violence assail<br /> The kingdom of the heavens, and overcome<br /> The
      will of the Most high; not in such sort<br /> As man prevails o'er man; but
      conquers it,<br /> Because 't is willing to be conquer'd, still,<br />
      Though conquer'd, by its mercy conquering.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those,
      in the eye who live the first and fifth,<br /> Cause thee to marvel, in
      that thou behold'st<br /> The region of the angels deck'd with them.<br />
      They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem'st,<br /> Gentiles but
      Christians, in firm rooted faith,<br /> This of the feet in future to be
      pierc'd,<br /> That of feet nail'd already to the cross.<br /> One from the
      barrier of the dark abyss,<br /> Where never any with good will returns,<br />
      Came back unto his bones. &nbsp;Of lively hope<br /> Such was the meed; of
      lively hope, that wing'd<br /> The prayers sent up to God for his release,<br />
      And put power into them to bend his will.<br /> The glorious Spirit, of
      whom I speak to thee,<br /> A little while returning to the flesh,<br />
      Believ'd in him, who had the means to help,<br /> And, in believing,
      nourish'd such a flame<br /> Of holy love, that at the second death<br /> He
      was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.<br /> The other, through the riches
      of that grace,<br /> Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,<br /> As
      never eye created saw its rising,<br /> Plac'd all his love below on just
      and right:<br /> Wherefore of grace God op'd in him the eye<br /> To the
      redemption of mankind to come;<br /> Wherein believing, he endur'd no more<br />
      The filth of paganism, and for their ways<br /> Rebuk'd the stubborn
      nations. &nbsp;The three nymphs,<br /> Whom at the right wheel thou
      beheldst advancing,<br /> Were sponsors for him more than thousand years<br />
      Before baptizing. &nbsp;O how far remov'd,<br /> Predestination! is thy
      root from such<br /> As see not the First cause entire: and ye,<br /> O
      mortal men! be wary how ye judge:<br /> For we, who see our Maker, know not
      yet<br /> The number of the chosen: and esteem<br /> Such scantiness of
      knowledge our delight:<br /> For all our good is in that primal good<br />
      Concentrate, and God's will and ours are one."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So,
      by that form divine, was giv'n to me<br /> Sweet medicine to clear and
      strengthen sight,<br /> And, as one handling skillfully the harp,<br />
      Attendant on some skilful songster's voice<br /> Bids the chords vibrate,
      and therein the song<br /> Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,<br />
      It doth remember me, that I beheld<br /> The pair of blessed luminaries
      move.<br /> Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes,<br /> Their beamy
      circlets, dancing to the sounds. <br /><br /> <a name="link21" id="link21"></a>

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,<br /> So lofty
      was the summit; down whose steps<br /> I saw the splendours in such
      multitude<br /> Descending, ev'ry light in heav'n, methought,<br /> Was shed
      thence. &nbsp;As the rooks, at dawn of day<br /> Bestirring them to dry
      their feathers chill,<br /> Some speed their way a-field, and homeward
      some,<br /> Returning, cross their flight, while some abide<br /> And wheel
      around their airy lodge; so seem'd<br /> That glitterance, wafted on
      alternate wing,<br /> As upon certain stair it met, and clash'd<br /> Its
      shining. And one ling'ring near us, wax'd<br /> So bright, that in my
      thought: said: "The love,<br /> Which this betokens me, admits no doubt."<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwillingly from question I refrain,<br />
      To her, by whom my silence and my speech<br /> Are order'd, looking for a
      sign: whence she,<br /> Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,<br /> Saw
      wherefore I was silent, prompted me<br /> T' indulge the fervent wish; and
      I began:<br /> "I am not worthy, of my own desert,<br /> That thou shouldst
      answer me; but for her sake,<br /> Who hath vouchsaf'd my asking, spirit
      blest!<br /> That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,<br /> Which
      bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,<br /> Doth the sweet symphony of
      Paradise<br /> Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds<br /> Of rapt
      devotion ev'ry lower sphere?"<br /> "Mortal art thou in hearing as in
      sight;"<br /> Was the reply: "and what forbade the smile<br /> Of Beatrice
      interrupts our song.<br /> Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,<br />
      And of the light that vests me, I thus far<br /> Descend these hallow'd
      steps: not that more love<br /> Invites me; for lo! there aloft, as much<br />
      Or more of love is witness'd in those flames:<br /> But such my lot by
      charity assign'd,<br /> That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,<br />
      To execute the counsel of the Highest.<br /> "That in this court," said I,
      "O sacred lamp!<br /> Love no compulsion needs, but follows free<br /> Th'
      eternal Providence, I well discern:<br /> This harder find to deem, why of
      thy peers<br /> Thou only to this office wert foredoom'd."<br /> I had not
      ended, when, like rapid mill,<br /> Upon its centre whirl'd the light; and
      then<br /> The love, that did inhabit there, replied:<br /> "Splendour
      eternal, piercing through these folds,<br /> Its virtue to my vision knits,
      and thus<br /> Supported, lifts me so above myself,<br /> That on the
      sov'ran essence, which it wells from,<br /> I have the power to gaze: and
      hence the joy,<br /> Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze<br /> The
      keenness of my sight. &nbsp;But not the soul,<br /> That is in heav'n most
      lustrous, nor the seraph<br /> That hath his eyes most fix'd on God, shall
      solve<br /> What thou hast ask'd: for in th' abyss it lies<br /> Of th'
      everlasting statute sunk so low,<br /> That no created ken may fathom it.<br />
      And, to the mortal world when thou return'st,<br /> Be this reported; that
      none henceforth dare<br /> Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn.<br />
      The mind, that here is radiant, on the earth<br /> Is wrapt in mist. &nbsp;Look
      then if she may do,<br /> Below, what passeth her ability,<br /> When she is
      ta'en to heav'n." &nbsp;By words like these<br /> Admonish'd, I the
      question urg'd no more;<br /> And of the spirit humbly sued alone<br /> T'
      instruct me of its state. &nbsp;"'Twixt either shore<br /> Of Italy, nor
      distant from thy land,<br /> A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,<br /> The
      thunder doth not lift his voice so high,<br /> They call it Catria: at
      whose foot a cell<br /> Is sacred to the lonely Eremite,<br /> For worship
      set apart and holy rites."<br /> A third time thus it spake; then added:
      "There<br /> So firmly to God's service I adher'd,<br /> That with no
      costlier viands than the juice<br /> Of olives, easily I pass'd the heats<br />
      Of summer and the winter frosts, content<br /> In heav'n-ward musings.
      &nbsp;Rich were the returns<br /> And fertile, which that cloister once was
      us'd<br /> To render to these heavens: now 't is fall'n<br /> Into a waste
      so empty, that ere long<br /> Detection must lay bare its vanity<br />
      Pietro Damiano there was I yclept:<br /> Pietro the sinner, when before I
      dwelt<br /> Beside the Adriatic, in the house<br /> Of our blest Lady.
      &nbsp;Near upon my close<br /> Of mortal life, through much importuning<br />
      I was constrain'd to wear the hat that still<br /> From bad to worse it
      shifted.&mdash;Cephas came;<br /> He came, who was the Holy Spirit's
      vessel,<br /> Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc'd,<br /> At
      the first table. &nbsp;Modern Shepherd's need<br /> Those who on either
      hand may prop and lead them,<br /> So burly are they grown: and from behind<br />
      Others to hoist them. &nbsp;Down the palfrey's sides<br /> Spread their
      broad mantles, so as both the beasts<br /> Are cover'd with one skin.
      &nbsp;O patience! thou<br /> That lookst on this and doth endure so long."<br />
      I at those accents saw the splendours down<br /> From step to step alight,
      and wheel, and wax,<br /> Each circuiting, more beautiful. &nbsp;Round this<br />
      They came, and stay'd them; uttered them a shout<br /> So loud, it hath no
      likeness here: nor I<br /> Wist what it spake, so deaf'ning was the
      thunder." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <a name="link22"

      <br /> Astounded, to the guardian of my steps<br /> I turn'd me, like the
      chill, who always runs<br /> Thither for succour, where he trusteth most,<br />
      And she was like the mother, who her son<br /> Beholding pale and
      breathless, with her voice<br /> Soothes him, and he is cheer'd; for thus
      she spake,<br /> Soothing me: "Know'st not thou, thou art in heav'n?<br />
      And know'st not thou, whatever is in heav'n,<br /> Is holy, and that
      nothing there is done<br /> But is done zealously and well? &nbsp;Deem now,<br />
      What change in thee the song, and what my smile<br /> had wrought, since
      thus the shout had pow'r to move thee.<br /> In which couldst thou have
      understood their prayers,<br /> The vengeance were already known to thee,<br />
      Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,<br /> The sword of heav'n is
      not in haste to smite,<br /> Nor yet doth linger, save unto his seeming,<br />
      Who in desire or fear doth look for it.<br /> But elsewhere now l bid thee
      turn thy view;<br /> So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold."<br /> Mine
      eyes directing, as she will'd, I saw<br /> A hundred little spheres, that
      fairer grew<br /> By interchange of splendour. &nbsp;I remain'd,<br /> As
      one, who fearful of o'er-much presuming,<br /> Abates in him the keenness
      of desire,<br /> Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,<br /> One
      largest and most lustrous onward drew,<br /> That it might yield
      contentment to my wish;<br /> And from within it these the sounds I heard.<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If thou, like me, beheldst the charity<br />
      That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,<br /> Were utter'd. &nbsp;But
      that, ere the lofty bound<br /> Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,<br />
      I will make answer even to the thought,<br /> Which thou hast such respect
      of. &nbsp;In old days,<br /> That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,<br />
      Was on its height frequented by a race<br /> Deceived and ill dispos'd: and
      I it was,<br /> Who thither carried first the name of Him,<br /> Who brought
      the soul-subliming truth to man.<br /> And such a speeding grace shone over
      me,<br /> That from their impious worship I reclaim'd<br /> The dwellers
      round about, who with the world<br /> Were in delusion lost. &nbsp;These
      other flames,<br /> The spirits of men contemplative, were all<br />
      Enliven'd by that warmth, whose kindly force<br /> Gives birth to flowers
      and fruits of holiness.<br /> Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:<br /> And
      here my brethren, who their steps refrain'd<br /> Within the cloisters, and
      held firm their heart."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
      answ'ring, thus; "Thy gentle words and kind,<br /> And this the cheerful
      semblance, I behold<br /> Not unobservant, beaming in ye all,<br /> Have
      rais'd assurance in me, wakening it<br /> Full-blossom'd in my bosom, as a
      rose<br /> Before the sun, when the consummate flower<br /> Has spread to
      utmost amplitude. &nbsp;Of thee<br /> Therefore entreat I, father! to
      declare<br /> If I may gain such favour, as to gaze<br /> Upon thine image,
      by no covering veil'd."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother!"
      &nbsp;he thus rejoin'd, "in the last sphere<br /> Expect completion of thy
      lofty aim,<br /> For there on each desire completion waits,<br /> And there
      on mine: where every aim is found<br /> Perfect, entire, and for
      fulfillment ripe.<br /> There all things are as they have ever been:<br />
      For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,<br /> Our ladder reaches even
      to that clime,<br /> And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.<br /> Thither
      the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch<br /> Its topmost round, when it
      appear'd to him<br /> With angels laden. &nbsp;But to mount it now<br />
      None lifts his foot from earth: and hence my rule<br /> Is left a
      profitless stain upon the leaves;<br /> The walls, for abbey rear'd, turned
      into dens,<br /> The cowls to sacks choak'd up with musty meal.<br /> Foul
      usury doth not more lift itself<br /> Against God's pleasure, than that
      fruit which makes<br /> The hearts of monks so wanton: for whate'er<br /> Is
      in the church's keeping, all pertains.<br /> To such, as sue for heav'n's
      sweet sake, and not<br /> To those who in respect of kindred claim,<br /> Or
      on more vile allowance. &nbsp;Mortal flesh<br /> Is grown so dainty, good
      beginnings last not<br /> From the oak's birth, unto the acorn's setting.<br />
      His convent Peter founded without gold<br /> Or silver; I with pray'rs and
      fasting mine;<br /> And Francis his in meek humility.<br /> And if thou note
      the point, whence each proceeds,<br /> Then look what it hath err'd to,
      thou shalt find<br /> The white grown murky. &nbsp;Jordan was turn'd back;<br />
      And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,<br /> May at God's pleasure work
      amendment here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, to his
      assembly back he drew:<br /> And they together cluster'd into one,<br />
      Then all roll'd upward like an eddying wind.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      sweet dame beckon'd me to follow them:<br /> And, by that influence only,
      so prevail'd<br /> Over my nature, that no natural motion,<br /> Ascending
      or descending here below,<br /> Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied.<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, reader, as my hope is to return<br />
      Unto the holy triumph, for the which<br /> I ofttimes wail my sins, and
      smite my breast,<br /> Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting<br />
      Thy finger in the fire, than I was, ere<br /> The sign, that followeth
      Taurus, I beheld,<br /> And enter'd its precinct. &nbsp;O glorious stars!<br />
      O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!<br /> To whom whate'er of genius
      lifteth me<br /> Above the vulgar, grateful I refer;<br /> With ye the
      parent of all mortal life<br /> Arose and set, when I did first inhale<br />
      The Tuscan air; and afterward, when grace<br /> Vouchsaf'd me entrance to
      the lofty wheel<br /> That in its orb impels ye, fate decreed<br /> My
      passage at your clime. &nbsp;To you my soul<br /> Devoutly sighs, for
      virtue even now<br /> To meet the hard emprize that draws me on.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou
      art so near the sum of blessedness,"<br /> Said Beatrice, "that behooves
      thy ken<br /> Be vigilant and clear. &nbsp;And, to this end,<br /> Or even
      thou advance thee further, hence<br /> Look downward, and contemplate, what
      a world<br /> Already stretched under our feet there lies:<br /> So as thy
      heart may, in its blithest mood,<br /> Present itself to the triumphal
      throng,<br /> Which through the' etherial concave comes rejoicing."<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I straight obey'd; and with mine eye
      return'd<br /> Through all the seven spheres, and saw this globe<br /> So
      pitiful of semblance, that perforce<br /> It moved my smiles: and him in
      truth I hold<br /> For wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughts<br />
      Elsewhere are fix'd, him worthiest call and best.<br /> I saw the daughter
      of Latona shine<br /> Without the shadow, whereof late I deem'd<br /> That
      dense and rare were cause. &nbsp;Here I sustain'd<br /> The visage,
      Hyperion! of thy sun;<br /> And mark'd, how near him with their circle,
      round<br /> Move Maia and Dione; here discern'd<br /> Jove's tempering
      'twixt his sire and son; and hence<br /> Their changes and their various

      not learn.<br /> This petty area (o'er the which we stride<br /> So
      fiercely), as along the eternal twins<br /> I wound my way, appear'd before

    <p>
      <br /> E'en as the bird, who midst the leafy bower<br /> Has, in her nest,
      sat darkling through the night,<br /> With her sweet brood, impatient to
      descry<br /> Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,<br /> In the
      fond quest unconscious of her toil:<br /> She, of the time prevenient, on
      the spray,<br /> That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze<br /> Expects
      the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,<br /> Removeth from the east her eager
      ken;<br /> So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance<br /> Wistfully on
      that region, where the sun<br /> Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her<br />
      Suspense and wand'ring, I became as one,<br /> In whom desire is waken'd,
      and the hope<br /> Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short
      space ensued; I was not held, I say,<br /> Long in expectance, when I saw
      the heav'n<br /> Wax more and more resplendent; and, "Behold,"<br /> Cried
      Beatrice, "the triumphal hosts<br /> Of Christ, and all the harvest reap'd
      at length<br /> Of thy ascending up these spheres." &nbsp;Meseem'd,<br />
      That, while she spake her image all did burn,<br /> And in her eyes such
      fullness was of joy,<br /> And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
      in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,<br /> In peerless beauty, 'mid
      th' eternal nympus,<br /> That paint through all its gulfs the blue
      profound<br /> In bright pre-eminence so saw I there,<br /> O'er million
      lamps a sun, from whom all drew<br /> Their radiance as from ours the
      starry train:<br /> And through the living light so lustrous glow'd<br />
      The substance, that my ken endur'd it not.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O
      Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!<br /> Who cheer'd me with her
      comfortable words!<br /> "Against the virtue, that o'erpow'reth thee,<br />
      Avails not to resist. &nbsp;Here is the might,<br /> And here the wisdom,
      which did open lay<br /> The path, that had been yearned for so long,<br />
      Betwixt the heav'n and earth." &nbsp;Like to the fire,<br /> That, in a
      cloud imprison'd doth break out<br /> Expansive, so that from its womb
      enlarg'd,<br /> It falleth against nature to the ground;<br /> Thus in that
      heav'nly banqueting my soul<br /> Outgrew herself; and, in the transport
      lost.<br /> Holds now remembrance none of what she was.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ope
      thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seen<br /> Things, that empower
      thee to sustain my smile."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was
      as one, when a forgotten dream<br /> Doth come across him, and he strives
      in vain<br /> To shape it in his fantasy again,<br /> Whenas that gracious
      boon was proffer'd me,<br /> Which never may be cancel'd from the book,<br />
      Wherein the past is written. &nbsp;Now were all<br /> Those tongues to
      sound, that have on sweetest milk<br /> Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed<br />
      And fatten'd, not with all their help to boot,<br /> Unto the thousandth
      parcel of the truth,<br /> My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,<br />
      flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.<br /> And with such figuring
      of Paradise<br /> The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets<br /> A
      sudden interruption to his road.<br /> But he, who thinks how ponderous the
      theme,<br /> And that 't is lain upon a mortal shoulder,<br /> May pardon,
      if it tremble with the burden.<br /> The track, our ventrous keel must
      furrow, brooks<br /> No unribb'd pinnace, no self-sparing pilot.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why
      doth my face," said Beatrice, "thus<br /> Enamour thee, as that thou dost
      not turn<br /> Unto the beautiful garden, blossoming<br /> Beneath the rays
      of Christ? &nbsp;Here is the rose,<br /> Wherein the word divine was made
      incarnate;<br /> And here the lilies, by whose odour known<br /> The way of
      life was follow'd." &nbsp;Prompt I heard<br /> Her bidding, and encounter
      once again<br /> The strife of aching vision. &nbsp;As erewhile,<br />
      Through glance of sunlight, stream'd through broken cloud,<br /> Mine eyes
      a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,<br /> Though veil'd themselves in
      shade; so saw I there<br /> Legions of splendours, on whom burning rays<br />
      Shed lightnings from above, yet saw I not<br /> The fountain whence they
      flow'd. &nbsp;O gracious virtue!<br /> Thou, whose broad stamp is on them,
      higher up<br /> Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room<br /> To my
      o'erlabour'd sight: when at the name<br /> Of that fair flower, whom duly I
      invoke<br /> Both morn and eve, my soul, with all her might<br /> Collected,
      on the goodliest ardour fix'd.<br /> And, as the bright dimensions of the
      star<br /> In heav'n excelling, as once here on earth<br /> Were, in my
      eyeballs lively portray'd,<br /> Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,<br />
      Circling in fashion of a diadem,<br /> And girt the star, and hov'ring
      round it wheel'd.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever melody
      sounds sweetest here,<br /> And draws the spirit most unto itself,<br />
      Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,<br /> Compar'd unto the
      sounding of that lyre,<br /> Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlays<br />
      The floor of heav'n, was crown'd. "Angelic Love,<br /> I am, who thus with
      hov'ring flight enwheel<br /> The lofty rapture from that womb inspir'd,<br />
      Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,<br /> Lady of Heav'n! will
      hover; long as thou<br /> Thy Son shalt follow, and diviner joy<br /> Shall
      from thy presence gild the highest sphere."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
      close was to the circling melody:<br /> And, as it ended, all the other
      lights<br /> Took up the strain, and echoed Mary's name.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      robe, that with its regal folds enwraps<br /> The world, and with the
      nearer breath of God<br /> Doth burn and quiver, held so far retir'd<br />
      Its inner hem and skirting over us,<br /> That yet no glimmer of its
      majesty<br /> Had stream'd unto me: therefore were mine eyes<br /> Unequal
      to pursue the crowned flame,<br /> That rose and sought its natal seed of
      fire;<br /> And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms<br /> For very
      eagerness towards the breast,<br /> After the milk is taken; so
      outstretch'd<br /> Their wavy summits all the fervent band,<br /> Through
      zealous love to Mary: then in view<br /> There halted, and "Regina Coeli"
      sang<br /> So sweetly, the delight hath left me never.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O
      what o'erflowing plenty is up-pil'd<br /> In those rich-laden coffers,
      which below<br /> Sow'd the good seed, whose harvest now they keep.<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the treasures tasted, that
      with tears<br /> Were in the Babylonian exile won,<br /> When gold had
      fail'd them. &nbsp;Here in synod high<br /> Of ancient council with the new
      conven'd,<br /> Under the Son of Mary and of God,<br /> Victorious he his
      mighty triumph holds,<br /> To whom the keys of glory were assign'd. <br /><br />

      soon as it was stay'd:<br /> To whom she thus: "O everlasting light<br /> Of

      Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou<br /> Hast there thy ken,
      where all things are beheld<br /> In liveliest portraiture. &nbsp;But since
      true faith<br /> Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,<br /> Meet is,
      that to exalt its glory more,<br /> Thou in his audience shouldst thereof

      who arms himself,<br /> And speaks not, till the master have propos'd<br />
      The question, to approve, and not to end it;<br /> So I, in silence, arm'd
      me, while she spake,<br /> Summoning up each argument to aid;<br /> As was
      behooveful for such questioner,<br /> And such profession: "As good
      Christian ought,<br /> Declare thee, What is faith?" &nbsp;Whereat I rais'd<br />
      My forehead to the light, whence this had breath'd,<br /> Then turn'd to
      Beatrice, and in her looks<br /> Approval met, that from their inmost fount<br />
      I should unlock the waters. &nbsp;"May the grace,<br /> That giveth me the
      captain of the church<br /> For confessor," said I, "vouchsafe to me<br />
      Apt utterance for my thoughts!" then added: "Sire!<br /> E'en as set down
      by the unerring style<br /> Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspir'd<br />
      To bring Rome in unto the way of life,<br /> Faith of things hop'd is

      Methinks its essence,"&mdash;"Rightly hast thou deem'd,"<br /> Was
      answer'd: "if thou well discern, why first<br /> He hath defin'd it,
      substance, and then proof."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The
      deep things," I replied, "which here I scan<br /> Distinctly, are below
      from mortal eye<br /> So hidden, they have in belief alone<br /> Their

      such belief our reasoning, all respect<br /> To other view excluded, hence
      of proof<br /> Th' intention is deriv'd." &nbsp;Forthwith I heard:<br /> "If
      thus, whate'er by learning men attain,<br /> Were understood, the sophist

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even so glittering and so round," said
      I,<br /> "I not a whit misdoubt of its assay."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next
      issued from the deep imbosom'd splendour:<br /> "Say, whence the costly

      me<br /> So feelingly, each argument beside<br /> Seems blunt and forceless
      in comparison."<br /> Then heard I: "Wherefore holdest thou that each,<br />
      The elder proposition and the new,<br /> Which so persuade thee, are the
      voice of heav'n?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The works, that
      follow'd, evidence their truth;"<br /> I answer'd: "Nature did not make for
      these<br /> The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them."<br /> "Who voucheth
      to thee of the works themselves,"<br /> Was the reply, "that they in very
      deed<br /> Are that they purport? &nbsp;None hath sworn so to thee."<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That all the world," said I, "should
      have been turn'd<br /> To Christian, and no miracle been wrought,<br />
      Would in itself be such a miracle,<br /> The rest were not an hundredth
      part so great.<br /> E'en thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger<br /> To
      set the goodly plant, that from the vine,<br /> It once was, now is grown
      unsightly bramble."<br /> That ended, through the high celestial court<br />
      Resounded all the spheres. &nbsp;"Praise we one God!"<br /> In song of most
      unearthly melody.<br /> And when that Worthy thus, from branch to branch,<br />
      Examining, had led me, that we now<br /> Approach'd the topmost bough, he
      straight resum'd;<br /> "The grace, that holds sweet dalliance with thy
      soul,<br /> So far discreetly hath thy lips unclos'd<br /> That, whatsoe'er
      has past them, I commend.<br /> Behooves thee to express, what thou
      believ'st,<br /> The next, and whereon thy belief hath grown."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O
      saintly sire and spirit!" &nbsp;I began,<br /> "Who seest that, which thou
      didst so believe,<br /> As to outstrip feet younger than thine own,<br />
      Toward the sepulchre? &nbsp;thy will is here,<br /> That I the tenour of my
      creed unfold;<br /> And thou the cause of it hast likewise ask'd.<br /> And
      I reply: I in one God believe,<br /> One sole eternal Godhead, of whose
      love<br /> All heav'n is mov'd, himself unmov'd the while.<br /> Nor
      demonstration physical alone,<br /> Or more intelligential and abstruse,<br />
      Persuades me to this faith; but from that truth<br /> It cometh to me
      rather, which is shed<br /> Through Moses, the rapt Prophets, and the
      Psalms.<br /> The Gospel, and that ye yourselves did write,<br /> When ye
      were gifted of the Holy Ghost.<br /> In three eternal Persons I believe,<br />
      Essence threefold and one, mysterious league<br /> Of union absolute,
      which, many a time,<br /> The word of gospel lore upon my mind<br />
      Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark,<br /> The lively flame
      dilates, and like heav'n's star<br /> Doth glitter in me." &nbsp;As the
      master hears,<br /> Well pleas'd, and then enfoldeth in his arms<br /> The
      servant, who hath joyful tidings brought,<br /> And having told the errand
      keeps his peace;<br /> Thus benediction uttering with song<br /> Soon as my
      peace I held, compass'd me thrice<br /> The apostolic radiance, whose
      behest<br /> Had op'd lips; so well their answer pleas'd. <br /><br /> <a

      cheering accents from the second flame<br /> Assur'd me; and mine eyes I

      I turn'd, but ah! how trembled in my thought,<br /> When, looking at my

      here appoints<br /> Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin'd;<br /> When thus I
      heard: "Wonder not, if my hue<br /> Be chang'd; for, while I speak, these
      shalt thou see<br /> All in like manner change with me. &nbsp;My place<br />
      He who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,<br /> Which in the presence of

      semblance did not alter more.<br /> "Not to this end was Christ's spouse
      with my blood,<br /> With that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:<br /> That she
      might serve for purchase of base gold:<br /> But for the purchase of this

      that the keys,<br /> Which were vouchsaf'd me, should for ensign serve<br />

      open thy lips, nor hide<br /> What is by me not hidden." &nbsp;As a Hood<br />
      Of frozen vapours streams adown the air,<br /> What time the she-goat with
      her skiey horn<br /> Touches the sun; so saw I there stream wide<br /> The

      ta'en<br /> His progress in the zodiac underneath.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
      by the spirit, that doth never leave<br /> Its amorous dalliance with my

      the human flesh,<br /> Or in its limn'd resemblance, can combine<br />
      Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal,<br /> Were to her beauty
      nothing. &nbsp;Its boon influence<br /> From the fair nest of Leda rapt me
      forth,<br /> And wafted on into the swiftest heav'n.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
      place for entrance Beatrice chose,<br /> I may not say, so uniform was all,<br />
      Liveliest and loftiest. &nbsp;She my secret wish<br /> Divin'd; and with
      such gladness, that God's love<br /> Seem'd from her visage shining, thus
      began:<br /> "Here is the goal, whence motion on his race<br /> Starts;
      motionless the centre, and the rest<br /> All mov'd around. &nbsp;Except
      the soul divine,<br /> Place in this heav'n is none, the soul divine,<br />

      As this doth clasp the others; and to Him,<br /> Who draws the bound, its
      limit only known.<br /> Measur'd itself by none, it doth divide<br /> Motion

      lift thy head above the waves<br /> Which whelm and sink thee down! &nbsp;The
      will in man<br /> Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise<br /> Is, by
      the dripping of perpetual rain,<br /> Made mere abortion: faith and
      innocence<br /> Are met with but in babes, each taking leave<br /> Ere
      cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,<br /> While yet a
      stammerer, with his tongue let loose<br /> Gluts every food alike in every
      moon.<br /> One yet a babbler, loves and listens to<br /> His mother; but no
      sooner hath free use<br /> Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave.<br />

      <br /> So she who doth imparadise my soul,<br /> Had drawn the veil from off
      our pleasant life,<br /> And bar'd the truth of poor mortality;<br /> When
      lo! as one who, in a mirror, spies<br /> The shining of a flambeau at his
      back,<br /> Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach,<br /> And turneth to
      resolve him, if the glass<br /> Have told him true, and sees the record

      their circles, none who spies,<br /> Can miss of, in itself apparent,
      struck<br /> On mine; a point I saw, that darted light<br /> So sharp, no
      lid, unclosing, may bear up<br /> Against its keenness. &nbsp;The least
      star we view<br /> From hence, had seem'd a moon, set by its side,<br /> As
      star by side of star. &nbsp;And so far off,<br /> Perchance, as is the halo
      from the light<br /> Which paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads,<br />
      There wheel'd about the point a circle of fire,<br /> More rapid than the
      motion, which first girds<br /> The world. &nbsp;Then, circle after circle,
      round<br /> Enring'd each other; till the seventh reach'd<br />
      Circumference so ample, that its bow,<br /> Within the span of Juno's
      messenger,<br /> lied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev'nth,<br />
      Follow'd yet other two. &nbsp;And every one,<br /> As more in number
      distant from the first,<br /> Was tardier in motion; and that glow'd<br />
      With flame most pure, that to the sparkle' of truth<br /> Was nearest, as
      partaking most, methinks,<br /> Of its reality. &nbsp;The guide belov'd<br />
      Saw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:<br /> "Heav'n, and all
      nature, hangs upon that point.<br /> The circle thereto most conjoin'd
      observe;<br /> And know, that by intenser love its course<br /> Is to this
      swiftness wing'd." &nbsp;To whom I thus:<br /> "It were enough; nor should
      I further seek,<br /> Had I but witness'd order, in the world<br />
      Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen.<br /> But in the sensible world
      such diff'rence is,<br /> That is each round shows more divinity,<br /> As
      each is wider from the centre. &nbsp;Hence,<br /> If in this wondrous and
      angelic temple,<br /> That hath for confine only light and love,<br /> My
      wish may have completion I must know,<br /> Wherefore such disagreement is
      between<br /> Th' exemplar and its copy: for myself,<br /> Contemplating, I
      fail to pierce the cause."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is
      no marvel, if thy fingers foil'd<br /> Do leave the knot untied: so hard 't
      is grown<br /> For want of tenting." &nbsp;Thus she said: "But take,"<br />
      She added, "if thou wish thy cure, my words,<br /> And entertain them
      subtly. &nbsp;Every orb<br /> Corporeal, doth proportion its extent<br />

      preserves the more.<br /> The greater is the body (if all parts<br /> Share
      equally) the more is to preserve.<br /> Therefore the circle, whose swift
      course enwheels<br /> The universal frame answers to that,<br /> Which is
      supreme in knowledge and in love<br /> Thus by the virtue, not the seeming,
      breadth<br /> Of substance, measure, thou shalt see the heav'ns,<br /> Each
      to the' intelligence that ruleth it,<br /> Greater to more, and smaller

      still opening buds<br /> In this eternal springtide blossom fair,<br />

      next then<br /> Virtues, and powers the third. &nbsp;The next to whom<br />

      ring; and last the band<br /> Angelical, disporting in their sphere.<br />
      All, as they circle in their orders, look<br /> Aloft, and downward with

      <br /> No longer than what time Latona's twins<br /> Cover'd of Libra and
      the fleecy star,<br /> Together both, girding the' horizon hang,<br /> In
      even balance from the zenith pois'd,<br /> Till from that verge, each,
      changing hemisphere,<br /> Part the nice level; e'en so brief a space<br />
      Did Beatrice's silence hold. &nbsp;A smile<br /> Bat painted on her cheek;
      and her fix'd gaze<br /> Bent on the point, at which my vision fail'd:<br />
      When thus her words resuming she began:<br /> "I speak, nor what thou
      wouldst inquire demand;<br /> For I have mark'd it, where all time and
      place<br /> Are present. &nbsp;Not for increase to himself<br /> Of good,
      which may not be increas'd, but forth<br /> To manifest his glory by its
      beams,<br /> Inhabiting his own eternity,<br /> Beyond time's limit or what
      bound soe'er<br /> To circumscribe his being, as he will'd,<br /> Into new
      natures, like unto himself,<br /> Eternal Love unfolded. &nbsp;Nor before,<br />
      As if in dull inaction torpid lay.<br /> For not in process of before or
      aft<br /> Upon these waters mov'd the Spirit of God.<br /> Simple and mix'd,
      both form and substance, forth<br /> To perfect being started, like three
      darts<br /> Shot from a bow three-corded. &nbsp;And as ray<br /> In crystal,
      glass, and amber, shines entire,<br /> E'en at the moment of its issuing;
      thus<br /> Did, from th' eternal Sovran, beam entire<br /> His threefold
      operation, at one act<br /> Produc'd coeval. &nbsp;Yet in order each<br />
      Created his due station knew: those highest,<br /> Who pure intelligence
      were made: mere power<br /> The lowest: in the midst, bound with strict
      league,<br /> Intelligence and power, unsever'd bond.<br /> Long tract of
      ages by the angels past,<br /> Ere the creating of another world,<br />
      Describ'd on Jerome's pages thou hast seen.<br /> But that what I disclose
      to thee is true,<br /> Those penmen, whom the Holy Spirit mov'd<br /> In
      many a passage of their sacred book<br /> Attest; as thou by diligent
      search shalt find<br /> And reason in some sort discerns the same,<br /> Who
      scarce would grant the heav'nly ministers<br /> Of their perfection void,
      so long a space.<br /> Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,<br />
      Thou know'st, and how: and knowing hast allay'd<br /> Thy thirst, which
      from the triple question rose.<br /> Ere one had reckon'd twenty, e'en so
      soon<br /> Part of the angels fell: and in their fall<br /> Confusion to
      your elements ensued.<br /> The others kept their station: and this task,<br />
      Whereon thou lookst, began with such delight,<br /> That they surcease not
      ever, day nor night,<br /> Their circling. &nbsp;Of that fatal lapse the
      cause<br /> Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen<br /> Pent with
      the world's incumbrance. &nbsp;Those, whom here<br /> Thou seest, were
      lowly to confess themselves<br /> Of his free bounty, who had made them apt<br />
      For ministries so high: therefore their views<br /> Were by enlight'ning
      grace and their own merit<br /> Exalted; so that in their will confirm'd<br />
      They stand, nor feel to fall. &nbsp;For do not doubt,<br /> But to receive
      the grace, which heav'n vouchsafes,<br /> Is meritorious, even as the soul<br />
      With prompt affection welcometh the guest.<br /> Now, without further help,
      if with good heed<br /> My words thy mind have treasur'd, thou henceforth<br />
      This consistory round about mayst scan,<br /> And gaze thy fill. &nbsp;But
      since thou hast on earth<br /> Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the
      schools,<br /> Canvas the' angelic nature, and dispute<br /> Its powers of
      apprehension, memory, choice;<br /> Therefore, 't is well thou take from me
      the truth,<br /> Pure and without disguise, which they below,<br />
      Equivocating, darken and perplex.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know
      thou, that, from the first, these substances,<br /> Rejoicing in the
      countenance of God,<br /> Have held unceasingly their view, intent<br />
      Upon the glorious vision, from the which<br /> Naught absent is nor hid:
      where then no change<br /> Of newness with succession interrupts,<br />
      Remembrance there needs none to gather up<br /> Divided thought and images
      remote<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So that men, thus at
      variance with the truth<br /> Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless
      some<br /> Of error; others well aware they err,<br /> To whom more guilt
      and shame are justly due.<br /> Each the known track of sage philosophy<br />
      Deserts, and has a byway of his own:<br /> So much the restless eagerness
      to shine<br /> And love of singularity prevail.<br /> Yet this, offensive as
      it is, provokes<br /> Heav'n's anger less, than when the book of God<br />
      Is forc'd to yield to man's authority,<br /> Or from its straightness
      warp'd: no reck'ning made<br /> What blood the sowing of it in the world<br />
      Has cost; what favour for himself he wins,<br /> Who meekly clings to it.
      &nbsp;The aim of all<br /> Is how to shine: e'en they, whose office is<br />
      To preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,<br /> And pass their own
      inventions off instead.<br /> One tells, how at Christ's suffering the wan
      moon<br /> Bent back her steps, and shadow'd o'er the sun<br /> With
      intervenient disk, as she withdrew:<br /> Another, how the light shrouded
      itself<br /> Within its tabernacle, and left dark<br /> The Spaniard and the
      Indian, with the Jew.<br /> Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,<br />
      Bandied about more frequent, than the names<br /> Of Bindi and of Lapi in
      her streets.<br /> The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return<br />
      From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails<br /> For their excuse, they
      do not see their harm?<br /> Christ said not to his first conventicle,<br />
      'Go forth and preach impostures to the world,'<br /> But gave them truth to
      build on; and the sound<br /> Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,<br />
      Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,<br /> To aid them in their
      warfare for the faith.<br /> The preacher now provides himself with store<br />
      Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack<br /> Of laughter, while he
      vents them, his big cowl<br /> Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:<br />
      Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while<br /> Of that dark bird
      which nestles in his hood,<br /> They scarce would wait to hear the
      blessing said.<br /> Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,<br /> That
      every counterfeit, who spreads abroad<br /> The hands of holy promise,
      finds a throng<br /> Of credulous fools beneath. &nbsp;Saint Anthony<br />
      Fattens with this his swine, and others worse<br /> Than swine, who diet at
      his lazy board,<br /> Paying with unstamp'd metal for their fare.<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But (for we far have wander'd) let us
      seek<br /> The forward path again; so as the way<br /> Be shorten'd with the
      time. &nbsp;No mortal tongue<br /> Nor thought of man hath ever reach'd so
      far,<br /> That of these natures he might count the tribes.<br /> What
      Daniel of their thousands hath reveal'd<br /> With finite number infinite
      conceals.<br /> The fountain at whose source these drink their beams,<br />
      With light supplies them in as many modes,<br /> As there are splendours,
      that it shines on: each<br /> According to the virtue it conceives,<br />
      Differing in love and sweet affection.<br /> Look then how lofty and how
      huge in breadth<br /> The' eternal might, which, broken and dispers'd<br />

      <br /> Noon's fervid hour perchance six thousand miles<br /> From hence is
      distant; and the shadowy cone<br /> Almost to level on our earth declines;<br />
      When from the midmost of this blue abyss<br /> By turns some star is to our

      forth her radiant brow, all, light by light,<br /> Fade, and the spangled
      firmament shuts in,<br /> E'en to the loveliest of the glittering throng.<br />
      Thus vanish'd gradually from my sight<br /> The triumph, which plays ever

      by that it girdeth. &nbsp;Wherefore love,<br /> With loss of other object,
      forc'd me bend<br /> Mine eyes on Beatrice once again.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
      all, that hitherto is told of her,<br /> Were in one praise concluded, 't
      were too weak<br /> To furnish out this turn. &nbsp;Mine eyes did look<br />
      On beauty, such, as I believe in sooth,<br /> Not merely to exceed our
      human, but,<br /> That save its Maker, none can to the full<br /> Enjoy it.
      &nbsp;At this point o'erpower'd I fail,<br /> Unequal to my theme, as never

      follow them no more;<br /> My course here bounded, as each artist's is,<br />
      When it doth touch the limit of his skill.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
      (such as I bequeath her to the bruit<br /> Of louder trump than mine, which
      hasteneth on,<br /> Urging its arduous matter to the close),<br /> Her words
      resum'd, in gesture and in voice<br /> Resembling one accustom'd to
      command:<br /> "Forth from the last corporeal are we come<br /> Into the
      heav'n, that is unbodied light,<br /> Light intellectual replete with love,<br />
      Love of true happiness replete with joy,<br /> Joy, that transcends all
      sweetness of delight.<br /> Here shalt thou look on either mighty host<br />
      Of Paradise; and one in that array,<br /> Which in the final judgment thou
      shalt see."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the lightning,
      in a sudden spleen<br /> Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes<br /> The
      visive spirits dazzled and bedimm'd;<br /> So, round about me, fulminating
      streams<br /> Of living radiance play'd, and left me swath'd<br /> And
      veil'd in dense impenetrable blaze.<br /> Such weal is in the love, that
      stills this heav'n;<br /> For its own flame the torch this fitting ever!<br />
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner to my list'ning ear had come<br />
      The brief assurance, than I understood<br /> New virtue into me infus'd,
      and sight<br /> Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain<br /> Excess of
      light, however pure. &nbsp;I look'd;<br /> And in the likeness of a river
      saw<br /> Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves<br /> Flash'd up
      effulgence, as they glided on<br /> 'Twixt banks, on either side, painted
      with spring,<br /> Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,<br /> There ever
      and anon, outstarting, flew<br /> Sparkles instinct with life; and in the
      flow'rs<br /> Did set them, like to rubies chas'd in gold;<br /> Then, as if
      drunk with odors, plung'd again<br /> Into the wondrous flood; from which,
      as one<br /> Re'enter'd, still another rose. &nbsp;"The thirst<br /> Of
      knowledge high, whereby thou art inflam'd,<br /> To search the meaning of
      what here thou seest,<br /> The more it warms thee, pleases me the more.<br />
      But first behooves thee of this water drink,<br /> Or ere that longing be

      subjoin'd:<br /> "This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,<br />
      And diving back, a living topaz each,<br /> With all this laughter on its
      bloomy shores,<br /> Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth<br /> They
      emblem: not that, in themselves, the things<br /> Are crude; but on thy
      part is the defect,<br /> For that thy views not yet aspire so high."<br />
      Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,<br /> Rush, with such eager
      straining, to the milk,<br /> As I toward the water, bending me,<br /> To
      make the better mirrors of mine eyes<br /> In the refining wave; and, as
      the eaves<br /> Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith<br /> Seem'd it
      unto me turn'd from length to round,<br /> Then as a troop of maskers, when
      they put<br /> Their vizors off, look other than before,<br /> The
      counterfeited semblance thrown aside;<br /> So into greater jubilee were
      chang'd<br /> Those flowers and sparkles, and distinct I saw<br /> Before me
      either court of heav'n displac'd.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O

      Makes the Creator visible to all<br /> Created, that in seeing him alone<br />
      Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far,<br /> That the circumference
      were too loose a zone<br /> To girdle in the sun. &nbsp;All is one beam,<br />
      Reflected from the summit of the first,<br /> That moves, which being hence
      and vigour takes,<br /> And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes<br />
      Its image mirror'd in the crystal flood,<br /> As if 't admire its brave
      appareling<br /> Of verdure and of flowers: so, round about,<br /> Eyeing
      the light, on more than million thrones,<br /> Stood, eminent, whatever
      from our earth<br /> Has to the skies return'd. &nbsp;How wide the leaves<br />

      such a space<br /> Of ample radiance! &nbsp;Yet, nor amplitude<br /> Nor

      that joy.<br /> Near or remote, what there avails, where God<br /> Immediate

      the rose<br /> Perennial, which in bright expansiveness,<br /> Lays forth
      its gradual blooming, redolent<br /> Of praises to the never-wint'ring sun,<br />
      As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace,<br /> Beatrice led me;

      For my deliverance apt, hast left untried.<br /> Thy liberal bounty still
      toward me keep.<br /> That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,<br />
      Is loosen'd from this body, it may find<br /> Favour with thee." &nbsp;So I
      my suit preferr'd:<br /> And she, so distant, as appear'd, look'd down,<br />
      And smil'd; then tow'rds th' eternal fountain turn'd.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
      thus the senior, holy and rever'd:<br /> "That thou at length mayst happily
      conclude<br /> Thy voyage (to which end I was dispatch'd,<br /> By
      supplication mov'd and holy love)<br /> Let thy upsoaring vision range, at
      large,<br /> This garden through: for so, by ray divine<br /> Kindled, thy
      ken a higher flight shall mount;<br /> And from heav'n's queen, whom
      fervent I adore,<br /> All gracious aid befriend us; for that I<br /> Am her
      own faithful Bernard." &nbsp;Like a wight,<br /> Who haply from Croatia
      wends to see<br /> Our Veronica, and the while 't is shown,<br /> Hangs over
      it with never-sated gaze,<br /> And, all that he hath heard revolving,
      saith<br /> Unto himself in thought: "And didst thou look<br /> E'en thus, O
      Jesus, my true Lord and God?<br /> And was this semblance thine?" &nbsp;So
      gaz'd I then<br /> Adoring; for the charity of him,<br /> Who musing, in the
      world that peace enjoy'd,<br /> Stood lively before me. &nbsp;"Child of
      grace!"<br /> Thus he began: "thou shalt not knowledge gain<br /> Of this
      glad being, if thine eyes are held<br /> Still in this depth below. &nbsp;But
      search around<br /> The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy<br /> Seated
      in state, the queen, that of this realm<br /> Is sovran." &nbsp;Straight
      mine eyes I rais'd; and bright,<br /> As, at the birth of morn, the eastern
      clime<br /> Above th' horizon, where the sun declines;<br /> To mine eyes,
      that upward, as from vale<br /> To mountain sped, at th' extreme bound, a
      part<br /> Excell'd in lustre all the front oppos'd.<br /> And as the glow
      burns ruddiest o'er the wave,<br /> That waits the sloping beam, which
      Phaeton<br /> Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light<br /> Diminish'd
      fades, intensest in the midst;<br /> So burn'd the peaceful oriflame, and
      slack'd<br /> On every side the living flame decay'd.<br /> And in that
      midst their sportive pennons wav'd<br /> Thousands of angels; in
      resplendence each<br /> Distinct, and quaint adornment. At their glee<br />
      And carol, smil'd the Lovely One of heav'n,<br /> That joy was in the eyes
      of all the blest.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I a tongue
      in eloquence as rich,<br /> As is the colouring in fancy's loom,<br /> 'T
      were all too poor to utter the least part<br /> Of that enchantment. &nbsp;When
      he saw mine eyes<br /> Intent on her, that charm'd him, Bernard gaz'd<br />
      With so exceeding fondness, as infus'd<br /> Ardour into my breast, unfelt
      before. <br /><br /> <a name="link32" id="link32"></a> <br /><br />

    <p>
      <br /> Freely the sage, though wrapt in musings high,<br /> Assum'd the
      teacher's part, and mild began:<br /> "The wound, that Mary clos'd, she
      open'd first,<br /> Who sits so beautiful at Mary's feet.<br /> The third in
      order, underneath her, lo!<br /> Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,<br />
      Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,<br /> Meek ancestress of him, who
      sang the songs<br /> Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.<br /> All, as
      I name them, down from deaf to leaf,<br /> Are in gradation throned on the
      rose.<br /> And from the seventh step, successively,<br /> Adown the
      breathing tresses of the flow'r<br /> Still doth the file of Hebrew dames
      proceed.<br /> For these are a partition wall, whereby<br /> The sacred
      stairs are sever'd, as the faith<br /> In Christ divides them. &nbsp;On
      this part, where blooms<br /> Each leaf in full maturity, are set<br /> Such
      as in Christ, or ere he came, believ'd.<br /> On th' other, where an
      intersected space<br /> Yet shows the semicircle void, abide<br /> All they,
      who look'd to Christ already come.<br /> And as our Lady on her glorious
      stool,<br /> And they who on their stools beneath her sit,<br /> This way
      distinction make: e'en so on his,<br /> The mighty Baptist that way marks
      the line<br /> (He who endur'd the desert and the pains<br /> Of martyrdom,
      and for two years of hell,<br /> Yet still continued holy), and beneath,<br />
      Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,<br /> Thus far from round to
      round. &nbsp;So heav'n's decree<br /> Forecasts, this garden equally to
      fill.<br /> With faith in either view, past or to come,<br /> Learn too,
      that downward from the step, which cleaves<br /> Midway the twain
      compartments, none there are<br /> Who place obtain for merit of their own,<br />
      But have through others' merit been advanc'd,<br /> On set conditions:
      spirits all releas'd,<br /> Ere for themselves they had the power to
      choose.<br /> And, if thou mark and listen to them well,<br /> Their
      childish looks and voice declare as much.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here,
      silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;<br /> And gladly will I loose the
      knot, wherein<br /> Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee. &nbsp;From this
      realm<br /> Excluded, chalice no entrance here may find,<br /> No more shall
      hunger, thirst, or sorrow can.<br /> A law immutable hath establish'd all;<br />
      Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,<br /> Exactly, as the
      finger to the ring.<br /> It is not therefore without cause, that these,<br />
      O'erspeedy comers to immortal life,<br /> Are different in their shares of
      excellence.<br /> Our Sovran Lord&mdash;that settleth this estate<br /> In
      love and in delight so absolute,<br /> That wish can dare no further&mdash;every
      soul,<br /> Created in his joyous sight to dwell,<br /> With grace at
      pleasure variously endows.<br /> And for a proof th' effect may well
      suffice.<br /> And 't is moreover most expressly mark'd<br /> In holy
      scripture, where the twins are said<br /> To, have struggled in the womb.
      &nbsp;Therefore, as grace<br /> Inweaves the coronet, so every brow<br />
      Weareth its proper hue of orient light.<br /> And merely in respect to his
      prime gift,<br /> Not in reward of meritorious deed,<br /> Hath each his
      several degree assign'd.<br /> In early times with their own innocence<br />
      More was not wanting, than the parents' faith,<br /> To save them: those
      first ages past, behoov'd<br /> That circumcision in the males should imp<br />
      The flight of innocent wings: but since the day<br /> Of grace hath come,
      without baptismal rites<br /> In Christ accomplish'd, innocence herself<br />
      Must linger yet below. &nbsp;Now raise thy view<br /> Unto the visage most
      resembling Christ:<br /> For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win<br />
      The pow'r to look on him." &nbsp;Forthwith I saw<br /> Such floods of
      gladness on her visage shower'd,<br /> From holy spirits, winging that
      profound;<br /> That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,<br /> Had not so much
      suspended me with wonder,<br /> Or shown me such similitude of God.<br />
      And he, who had to her descended, once,<br /> On earth, now hail'd in
      heav'n; and on pois'd wing.<br /> "Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena," sang:<br /> To
      whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,<br /> From all parts answ'ring,
      rang: that holier joy<br /> Brooded the deep serene. &nbsp;"Father rever'd:<br />
      Who deign'st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,<br /> Wherein thou
      sittest, by eternal lot!<br /> Say, who that angel is, that with such glee<br />
      Beholds our queen, and so enamour'd glows<br /> Of her high beauty, that
      all fire he seems."<br /> So I again resorted to the lore<br /> Of my wise
      teacher, he, whom Mary's charms<br /> Embellish'd, as the sun the morning
      star;<br /> Who thus in answer spake: "In him are summ'd,<br /> Whatever of
      buxomness and free delight<br /> May be in Spirit, or in angel, met:<br />
      And so beseems: for that he bare the palm<br /> Down unto Mary, when the
      Son of God<br /> Vouchsaf'd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds.<br /> Now
      let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,<br /> And note thou of this just
      and pious realm<br /> The chiefest nobles. &nbsp;Those, highest in bliss,<br />
      The twain, on each hand next our empress thron'd,<br /> Are as it were two
      roots unto this rose.<br /> He to the left, the parent, whose rash taste<br />
      Proves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,<br /> That ancient father of
      the holy church,<br /> Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys<br /> Of
      this sweet flow'r: near whom behold the seer,<br /> That, ere he died, saw
      all the grievous times<br /> Of the fair bride, who with the lance and
      nails<br /> Was won. &nbsp;And, near unto the other, rests<br /> The leader,
      under whom on manna fed<br /> Th' ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse.<br />
      On th' other part, facing to Peter, lo!<br /> Where Anna sits, so well
      content to look<br /> On her lov'd daughter, that with moveless eye<br />
      She chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos'd<br /> To the first father of
      your mortal kind,<br /> Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,<br /> When on
      the edge of ruin clos'd thine eye.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But
      (for the vision hasteneth so an end)<br /> Here break we off, as the good
      workman doth,<br /> That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:<br /> And
      to the primal love our ken shall rise;<br /> That thou mayst penetrate the
      brightness, far<br /> As sight can bear thee. &nbsp;Yet, alas! in sooth<br />
      Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance,<br /> Thou backward fall'st.
      &nbsp;Grace then must first be gain'd;<br /> Her grace, whose might can
      help thee. &nbsp;Thou in prayer<br /> Seek her: and, with affection, whilst
      I sue,<br /> Attend, and yield me all thy heart." &nbsp;He said,<br /> And
      thus the saintly orison began. <br /><br /> <a name="link33" id="link33"></a>

      CANTO XXXIII

    <p>
      <br /> "O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,<br /> Created beings all in
      lowliness<br /> Surpassing, as in height, above them all,<br /> Term by th'
      eternal counsel pre-ordain'd,<br /> Ennobler of thy nature, so advanc'd<br />
      In thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,<br /> Himself, in his own work
      enclos'd to dwell!<br /> For in thy womb rekindling shone the love<br />
      Reveal'd, whose genial influence makes now<br /> This flower to germin in
      eternal peace!<br /> Here thou to us, of charity and love,<br /> Art, as the
      noon-day torch: and art, beneath,<br /> To mortal men, of hope a living
      spring.<br /> So mighty art thou, lady! and so great,<br /> That he who
      grace desireth, and comes not<br /> To thee for aidance, fain would have
      desire<br /> Fly without wings. &nbsp;Nor only him who asks,<br /> Thy
      bounty succours, but doth freely oft<br /> Forerun the asking. &nbsp;Whatsoe'er
      may be<br /> Of excellence in creature, pity mild,<br /> Relenting mercy,
      large munificence,<br /> Are all combin'd in thee. &nbsp;Here kneeleth one,<br />
      Who of all spirits hath review'd the state,<br /> From the world's lowest
      gap unto this height.<br /> Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace<br />
      For virtue, yet more high to lift his ken<br /> Toward the bliss supreme.
      &nbsp;And I, who ne'er<br /> Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself,<br />
      Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,<br /> (And pray they be not
      scant) that thou wouldst drive<br /> Each cloud of his mortality away;<br />
      That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.<br /> This also I entreat of thee,
      O queen!<br /> Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou<br /> Wouldst
      after all he hath beheld, preserve<br /> Affection sound, and human
      passions quell.<br /> Lo! &nbsp;Where, with Beatrice, many a saint<br />
      Stretch their clasp'd hands, in furtherance of my suit!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      eyes, that heav'n with love and awe regards,<br /> Fix'd on the suitor,
      witness'd, how benign<br /> She looks on pious pray'rs: then fasten'd they<br />
      On th' everlasting light, wherein no eye<br /> Of creature, as may well be
      thought, so far<br /> Can travel inward. &nbsp;I, meanwhile, who drew<br />
      Near to the limit, where all wishes end,<br /> The ardour of my wish (for
      so behooved),<br /> Ended within me. Beck'ning smil'd the sage,<br /> That I
      should look aloft: but, ere he bade,<br /> Already of myself aloft I
      look'd;<br /> For visual strength, refining more and more,<br /> Bare me
      into the ray authentical<br /> Of sovran light. &nbsp;Thenceforward, what I
      saw,<br /> Was not for words to speak, nor memory's self<br /> To stand
      against such outrage on her skill.<br /> As one, who from a dream awaken'd,
      straight,<br /> All he hath seen forgets; yet still retains<br /> Impression
      of the feeling in his dream;<br /> E'en such am I: for all the vision dies,<br />
      As 't were, away; and yet the sense of sweet,<br /> That sprang from it,
      still trickles in my heart.<br /> Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow
      unseal'd;<br /> Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost<br /> The
      Sybil's sentence. &nbsp;O eternal beam!<br /> (Whose height what reach of
      mortal thought may soar?)<br /> Yield me again some little particle<br /> Of
      what thou then appearedst, give my tongue<br /> Power, but to leave one
      sparkle of thy glory,<br /> Unto the race to come, that shall not lose<br />
      Thy triumph wholly, if thou waken aught<br /> Of memory in me, and endure
      to hear<br /> The record sound in this unequal strain.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
      keenness from the living ray I met,<br /> That, if mine eyes had turn'd
      away, methinks,<br /> I had been lost; but, so embolden'd, on<br /> I
      pass'd, as I remember, till my view<br /> Hover'd the brink of dread
      infinitude.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O grace! unenvying of
      thy boon! that gav'st<br /> Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken<br /> On th'
      everlasting splendour, that I look'd,<br /> While sight was unconsum'd,
      and, in that depth,<br /> Saw in one volume clasp'd of love, whatever<br />
      The universe unfolds; all properties<br /> Of substance and of accident,
      beheld,<br /> Compounded, yet one individual light<br /> The whole. &nbsp;And
      of such bond methinks I saw<br /> The universal form: for that whenever<br />
      I do but speak of it, my soul dilates<br /> Beyond her proper self; and,
      till I speak,<br /> One moment seems a longer lethargy,<br /> Than
      five-and-twenty ages had appear'd<br /> To that emprize, that first made
      Neptune wonder<br /> At Argo's shadow darkening on his flood.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
      fixed heed, suspense and motionless,<br /> Wond'ring I gaz'd; and
      admiration still<br /> Was kindled, as I gaz'd. &nbsp;It may not be,<br />
      That one, who looks upon that light, can turn<br /> To other object,
      willingly, his view.<br /> For all the good, that will may covet, there<br />
      Is summ'd; and all, elsewhere defective found,<br /> Complete. &nbsp;My
      tongue shall utter now, no more<br /> E'en what remembrance keeps, than
      could the babe's<br /> That yet is moisten'd at his mother's breast.<br />
      Not that the semblance of the living light<br /> Was chang'd (that ever as
      at first remain'd)<br /> But that my vision quickening, in that sole<br />
      Appearance, still new miracles descry'd,<br /> And toil'd me with the
      change. &nbsp;In that abyss<br /> Of radiance, clear and lofty, seem'd
      methought,<br /> Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound:<br /> And,
      from another, one reflected seem'd,<br /> As rainbow is from rainbow: and
      the third<br /> Seem'd fire, breath'd equally from both. &nbsp;Oh speech<br />
      How feeble and how faint art thou, to give<br /> Conception birth! &nbsp;Yet
      this to what I saw<br /> Is less than little. &nbsp;Oh eternal light!<br />
      Sole in thyself that dwellst; and of thyself<br /> Sole understood, past,
      present, or to come!<br /> Thou smiledst; on that circling, which in thee<br />
      Seem'd as reflected splendour, while I mus'd;<br /> For I therein,
      methought, in its own hue<br /> Beheld our image painted: steadfastly<br />
      I therefore por'd upon the view. &nbsp;As one<br /> Who vers'd in geometric
      lore, would fain<br /> Measure the circle; and, though pondering long<br />
      And deeply, that beginning, which he needs,<br /> Finds not; e'en such was
      I, intent to scan<br /> The novel wonder, and trace out the form,<br /> How
      to the circle fitted, and therein<br /> How plac'd: but the flight was not
      for my wing;<br /> Had not a flash darted athwart my mind,<br /> And in the
      spleen unfolded what it sought.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here
      vigour fail'd the tow'ring fantasy:<br /> But yet the will roll'd onward,
      like a wheel<br /> In even motion, by the Love impell'd,<br /> That moves
      the sun in heav'n and all the stars. <br /> <br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
