High Level Decomposition
Problem: Write a program 'fw' that will return a sorted list of the n most
common words in a file or set of files, sorted by order of frequency.

1. Parse Command Line Arguments and Input Data
    - Conditional structure to call correct subroutine based on cli arguments
    - Common string parsing methods will be required to parse arguments
    - Test: Echo back command line arguments

2. Verify command-line arguments 
    - Route input data to correct subroutine based on arguments
    - Return error if faulty argument is supplied
    - Test: Echo back parsed command line arguments and "intented" subroutine
    - Test: Test with faulty arguments and verify graceful failure and correct
      return codes

3. Read in input data
    - Ingest input words supplied in file
    - Test: Echo back all words in file with correct definition of a 'word'

4. Store input data
    - Use hashmap to store strings in heap
    - Use fixed array list to store pointers to hashes of input strings in
      a struct with additional parameter (ie) count
    - Test: Verify that data can be stored and retrieved from the data
      structure

5. Get frequency
    - Iterate through array list calculate frequency of words and add to
      word struct
    - Test: Verify that method can correctly calculate the frequency of words
      on a variety of different list containing a variety of structs

6. Sort Array List
    - Sort array list by frequency which is an attr of each struct in the array
    - Will use quick sort
    - Test: Verify that sorting algorithm correctly sorts array following
      natural ordering defined in the algorithm. Use many edge cases of input
      arrays to test reliability
